AL,Albania,57,84,40,"In Albania, the legal framework established to regulate political finance receives high marks on the Campaign Finance Indicators. Practically speaking, however, enforcement is riddled with deficiencies. Despite the equitable and transparent distribution of direct public funds to political parties and independent candidates, non-financial state resources, like cars, staff, and buildings, the use of which is explicitly prohibited, were frequently abused during the most recent elections. Restrictions on contributions and expenditures are tightly regulated, but the evidence indicates that such restrictions, especially in regards to spending, are often circumvented in practice.  Despite fairly extensive reporting requirements, the information on contributors submitted to the Central Elections Commission (CEC) by parties and candidates is often incomplete. Audit reports of party finances that are available to the public adhere to different formats, and violations and/or abuses of the law happen regularly. Third party actors are marginal figures in Albanian elections, but their influence could increase in the future, as no regulations exist to affect the independent activities of such organizations during campaigns. The CEC, despite having strong legal powers, lacks the practical capacity to investigate and enforce political finance laws. Allegations of abuse, including vote buying, are prevalent, and the CEC in unable to practice effective enforcement in many cases.","Albania is a parliamentary republic with a unicameral legislature.  Parliament consists of 140 members elected through regional proportional representation every four years.  The most recent elections occurred in June of 2013.

The official head of state is the President, who is elected by parliament in a supermajority vote (3/5 of its members must support a nominee) after his candidacy is proposed by a group of no less than 20 members of parliament.

In the parliamentary elections held in the Republic of Albania on 23 June 2013, there were 68 political subjects, including 66 parties and two independent candidates. In this process were elected the 140 members of the parliament. Two coalitions were created by 61 political parties, i.e. the Alliance for European Albania Coalition (37 parties) and the Alliance for Employment, Welfare and Integration Coalition (24 parties). Upon completion of the voting process, the CEC decided (Decision No. 759, dated 06.08.2013) as follows:

The Alliance for European Albania Coalition was allocated 83 seats in the Assembly:
1. The Socialist Party received 713 407 votes, i.e. 41,36% or 65 mandates.
2. Socialist Movement for Integration received 180 470 votes, i.e. 10,46% or 16 mandates.
3. The Union for Human Rights Party received 14 722 votes, i.e. 0,85% or 1 mandate.
4. Democratic Christian Party received 7993 votes, i.e. 0,46% or 1 mandate.

The Alliance for Employment, Welfare and Integration Coalition received 57 seats in the Assembly.
1. The Democratic Party received 528 373 votes, i.e. 30,63% or 50 mandates.
2. The Republican Party received 52 168 votes, i.e. 3,02% or 3 mandates.
3. The Party for Justice, Integrity, and Unity received 44 957 votes, i.e. 2,61% or 4 mandates.

Candidates are selected for each electoral zone by the political parties, electoral coalitions, and voters. A candidate may only represent one party.  

Money is officially managed by the parties through the party bank accounts. According to our electoral law, individual candidates and coalitions are not obliged to declare their electoral funds and expenditures. In addition, individual candidates may not be direct beneficiaries of public funds. This, however, does not mean that candidates do not actually raise funds or make undeclared expenditures. Informality is quite wide-spread in Albania, both in the economic sectors, and in the society. There have been an increasing number of candidates in the last elections coming from business families, or owing considerable assets and companies.  

In the parliamentary elections held in the Republic of Albania on 23 June 2013, there were 68 political subjects, including 66 parties and two independent candidates. The political parties stated that they had accumulated a fund of 241,211,140 ALL  to support their campaign activities. It was the first time in the short history of the allegations about financial resources of election campaigns that donations were declared as the top source of funds in terms of their value.

According to what the parties claim, 50 % of the money made available to the campaign was money donated by donors. Public funds, on the other hand, were ranked as second, with only 27.59 % of the campaigns total fund. Parties’ own funds, i.e. membership fees accumulated through the years, were reported to have covered 15.3 % of their total campaign funds.

Parties’ own funds consist of the funds they get every year from the state budget (this applies to parliamentary parties only), interests of their bank deposits, membership fees, and even incomes from lease agreements, as was the case with one political party in the last elections.

Another source of funding available for the parties by law is free advertising provided by radio and television channels against the recognition of its cost by the Tax Office as a deductible expense. According to their financial statements, the political parties spent more than they were entitled to by law, causing thus electoral debts.  Such debt represents 36.54% of the total expenditures for the 2013 elections. It is the media, which is damaged by such debts, as most of the invoices issued by the media outlets were not paid.  However, none of the radio and TV stations, or other media companies, claimed the payment of this debt through the administrative or the regular district courts. The relationship between the media and political parties as a relationship between the debtor and the creditor affects the principle of independence both for the media. Still, electoral debt is a phenomenon that characterizes the three last elections, i.e. 2013; 2011; 2009, with the two largest parties currently in power being the main parties taking this approach."
AR,Argentina,72,91,60,"Argentina has a fairly sophisticated legal framework in place to govern the role of money during elections. In practice, parties receive the direct and indirect public funding to which they are due in law. In spite of clear prohibitions on their use in campaigns, non-financial state resources, including staff, were frequently deployed by the ruling party for electoral purposes during the 2013 campaign. The legal framework includes many restrictions on contribution and expenditure, but the MPT evidence suggests that all national parties violated political finance laws during the 2013 elections. Parties are required to report on their finances somewhat regularly, but in practice, filed reports often fail to include a full list of contributors.  All legal entities, including third party actors, are legally prohibited from engaging in electoral activities. Nevertheless, in practice, some activity occurs, and experts express concerns about the influence of organized crime syndicates during campaigns. The National Electoral Justice is the authority in charge of regulating political finance, and is widely recognized as independent and active. The NEJ carries out investigations and punishes violators, but since the sanctions spelled out in law are weak, parties continue to engage in political finance violations. In spite of its strong regulatory framework, Argentina's practical enforcement mechanisms are dogged by deficits of capacity and capability.","Argentina has national elections for a Presdiential executive and a bicameral congress. Voting in national elections is compulsory for citizens between 18 and 70 years old. 

The Legislative Branch is formed by two Chambers: Representatives’ Chamber and Senators’ Chamber.  Elections are partially simultaneous with presidential elections. A third of the Senate and half of the Representatives' Chamber are renewed every two years.

The Representatives Chamber is formed by 257 Deputies or Representatives, elected by half every two years. Their mandate is 4 years, and they can be re-elected indefinitely.  They are elected directly by citizens in each of the 24 districts (23 provinces and Buenos Aires City) through closed list with proportional representation. To each district corresponds an specific amount of seats, according to the population.

The Senators Chamber is formed by 72 Senators.  Three seats correspond to each of the 24 districts. Two senate seats per district go to the party receiving the highest number of votes, and the other seat goes to the first minority party. They are elected through a closed list, directly by the citizens of each district. 

Individual candidates are not allowed to participate in elections. Only political parties can nominate candidates in national elections.  Parties are the only actor allowed to receive funds and shall file complete reports on income and expenditures.

The most recent Legislative elections took place in October 2013, and the most recent simultaneous Presidential and legislative elections took place in October 2011.

The Argentine electoral system is complex because in it 25 electoral systems, one national and 24 provincial, interact. Districts can decide whether to hold simultaneous elections (for example provincial offices and national offices at the same time or separate elections for each level of positions)."
AT,Austria,33,36,45,"In Austria, political finance is subject to relatively little regulation. Parties are provided with direct public funding, though the fashion in which allocations and disbursements of state funds are made is not entirely transparent. The abuse of non-financial state resources in campaigns is not explicitly barred, but notably, in practice, no such abuses occurred during the most recent elections. Contributions are largely unrestricted, while both parties and candidates are limited to expenditures of no more than 7 million euros during the course of a campaign. The evidence indicates that at least two parties exceeded those expenditure caps during the 2013 parliamentary elections.  Reporting requirements are sparse: by law, parties must only submit annual financial reports to the electoral authority. In practice, few details are available, and not all reported information is available to the public in standardized, comparable formats. The independent political activities of third party actors are unregulated, and in practice, at least one such actor played a role in the 2013 campaign. Responsibilities for monitoring and enforcing political finance law is split between the Court of Audit and the Transparency Commission, each of which are largely independent, though the Transparency commission is still new, and thus difficult to assess.  The Commission is charged with investigating political finance issues, and does so in practice, but does not make any information on its work available to the public. By the conclusion of the study period, it had yet to impose any sanctions on violators of political finance laws.","Austria has a bicamerial legislature.  The National Council (Nationalrat) has 183 members that are elected for five-year terms through a proportional system of representation using candidate lists and preferential voting.  There are nine constituencies corresponding to the federal provinces, which are in turn divided into 39 regional constituencies, each of which has between one and eight seats depending on its population.  Voters choose a political party, and also can cast preferential votes for one national, one regional, and one local list candidate of the same party.  Parties have to pass a threshold of four per cent of the national vote to be represented in the National Council.

The Federal Council (Bundesrat) is composed of 61 members and represents the interests of the nine federal provinces. All members of the Federal Council are selected by the nine provincial parliaments according to the respective strength of political parties in the last provincial elections. The Federal Council has limited powers, as its veto can be overturned by the National Council with a simple majority vote.

Campaigns are largely funded and managed by the respective political party on a national level, whereby campaign activities are also carried out by regional and local party sections.

The most recent elections to the National Council took place in September of 2013.  The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ, 52 seats) is in a ruling coalition with the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP, 47 seats). The Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ, 40 seats), the Greens (Grüne, 24 seats), Team Stronach (11 seats) and NEOS (9 seats) are currently in opposition.

The President is the head of state and is elected directly by the people for a maximum of two consecutive six-year terms. According to the Austrian constitution, the President has some strong powers: he appoints the prime minister (Federal Chancellor – Bundeskanzler) and, upon proposal by the Federal Chancellor, also the other members of the federal government (ministers and state secretaries). 

The government also needs the support support of parliamentary majority: the National Council may force the government – and any minister – to resign by a vote of no confidence, which has to be supported by simple majority. For this reason the Austrian political system works mainly as a parliamentarian government, whereby in practice Members of Parliament of the ruling parties rarely ever question any action of the government; the role of the President is largely ceremonial. 

Within the government, the Federal Chancellor is head of the Federal Chancellery (Bundeskanzleramt, which also serves a ministry) but has only limited additional powers to coordinate work of the whole government."
AU,Australia,49,41,67,"The Australian political finance system is relatively sparse. Direct public funding is provided to candidates and parties, both in law and in practice, but no laws explicitly prohibit the use of non-financial state resources during campaigns, nor is there subsidized access to advertising. Few restrictions exist to limit contributions or expenditure during campaigns, and only contributions worth more than $12,400 (USD) must be reported. As a result, corporations and individual donors pour a good deal of money into politics, though ascertaining exact funding streams can be a difficult task. Parties and candidates submit financial reports regularly to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), and that information, in practice, is made available to the public in a standardized, machine readable format. In fact, Australia is one of two countries in the MPT sample to meet this standard. Third party actors who spend in excess of $12,400 in campaigns are required to report to the AEC, and that information is eventually made available to the public. Because of the absence of contribution limits, third party actors are not hugely important in Australian campaigns--money can legally be funneled directly to parties and candidates. The AEC is well-respected, and exercises independent investigations. It lacks, however, the legal authority to impose sanctions, and has not initiated prosecutions of violators in more than seven years.","Australia has a bicameral legislative system in which the Queen (or King) of England is the official head of state.  The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, who is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the government of the day.  The prime minister, elected as the leader of the party/coalition in government, acts as the head of government.

Australia is commonly referred to as having a ""Washminster"" system, as it meshes aspects of the British and US legislatures.  Government is formed by a majority in the House of Representatives, and the Prime Minister is traditionally a Member of the House.  The House and Senate have similar legislative powers, though monetary Bills (e.g. Budget, Bills with budgetary implications) need to be introduced in the house.  All legislation needs to be passed by both Houses in the same form, to be enacted.  

The lower house of Parliament, the House of Representatives, has 150 members who are elected via preferential voting in single member districts.  The upper house, the Senate, has a quasi-proportional voting system to elect its 76 members (12 from each of six states - irrespective of the number of voters in each state; and two from each of two territories).  Elections are held approximately every three years, for all House of Representatives seats, and half the state Senate seats (six-year terms) and all territory Senate seats. Although there is no formal requirement to do so, for practical reasons House and Senate elections have been held concurrently since 1974.  

Campaign funds are generally (though not always) managed by parties on behalf of their endorsed candidates, though candidates themselves are free to source donations.  Candidates can also manage their own funds, but this usually does not happen for larger parties.  Independent candidates, however, manage their own funds.  Parties submit financial figures for their endorsed candidates annually.  Campaign funds are generally managed by the party on behalf of their endorsed candidates.  

The most recent elections were held in September 2013, and in Western Australian, a second election for Senate positions was held in April 2014, following the 2013 election being declared void.  As a result of these elections, the Liberal/National Coalition won Government with 90 seats, the Labor Party, with 55 seats is the official Opposition, with minor parties and Independents holding the remaining five seats.

In the Senate, from July 2014 when newly-elected Senators take up their seats, the composition is 33 Coalition, 25 Labor, 10 Greens, 3 Palmer United,  and five minor party and Independent Senators.  This is typical of recent decades, where the government usually does not control a majority in the Senate (2005-07 being an exception)."
BA,Bosnia and Herzegovina,48,73,35,"Similar to many other Eastern European countries, Bosnia has created a sophisticated political finance regulatory system. In practice, however, de facto realities often do not align with the legal framework. In law, direct public funding exists for both parties and candidates, but allocations are not always made in accordance with the legal formula, and details on disbursements are published only long after money is distributed. Likewise, in law, parties are granted free, equitable access to public media during campaigns, but in practice, the time afforded to different parties frequently fails to accord with the legal requirements Furthermore, non-financial state resources are often abused during campaigns. Contributions and expenditures are highly regulated, though cash donations are not limited in any way. In practice, these limits were regularly contravened during the 2010 elections. Parties are required to report on their finances before and after elections, as well as annually. In practice, reports are often filed late, or not at all, and some contributions are frequently omitted. The Central Elections Commission (CEC) only publishes extracts of filed reports, so limited political finance information is available to the public. Despite reports of third party activity, the independent electioneering of such actors is not regulated by law. The CEC is granted strong legal powers to monitor and enforce political finance, but its ability to rigorously enforce political finance legislation is constrained by a lack of capacity and deficits in operational transparency. Though the CEC imposes sanctions, in practice, parties continue to violate the law, especially where reporting requirements are concerned, on a regular basis. Until more intimidating sanctions are legally defined, and the CEC is given the practical capacity to carry out its remit, enforcement may continue to suffer.","BiH has a bicameral parliamentary system of government, and the country is composed of two semi-autonomous entities, the Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republic of Srpska (RS).  The Brcko District has special status and doesn't belong to any entity but enjoys autonomy. .  Of the 42 members of the House of Representatives, 28 are elected in the Federation of BiH, and 14 are elected in the Republic of Srpska.  21 of the Federation representatives are elected in multi-member constituencies under a proportional represenation system, and seven are compensatory mandates elected from the territory of the Federation as a whole.  In the Republic of Srpska, nine MPs are elected in multi-member constituencies under proporational representation, and five are compensatory mandates elected from the territory as a whole.

The House of Peoples is composed of 15 delegates, 10 of whom come from the Federation (five Croats and five Bosniaks), and five come from the Republic of Srpska (five Serbs).  At the state level, there is Parliament of BiH with two chambers, state government and three member Presidency, which is collective head of state.  Members of this body are elected by entity Parliaments.

Members of the Presidency are directly elected, one from Republic of Srpska (must be a Serb) and two from Federation BiH (one Bosniac and one Croat)

The main source of financing political campaigns for parties already represented in parliaments is regular annual  transfer from budgets, membership fee from members of political party, income from publishing activity, profit from companies owned by party and contribution from individuals and private companies. Indeed, according to the official financial reports of political parties, most of the funds for the campaigns, as well as for the annual finance, come from the public subsidies awarded from all levels of government (as presented in the indicators related to the public funding). These funds, as well as membership fees, and most of the donations, are controlled and distributed by the parties, and camoaigns are run on the party level. However,  candidates (including those nominated by the party) have a possibility to raise their own funds and pay for their individual campaigns, while this part of campaign funding is not reported neither by the party nor by the candidate. 

In the 2010 election, the elected members of the presidency were: Zeljko Komsic (Social  Democratic Party - SDP), Bakir Izetbegovic (Party of Democratic Action - SDA), and Nebojsa Radmanovic (Alliance of Independent Social Democrats Milorad Dodik - SNSD Milorad Dodik). 

The seats in the national Parliamentary Assembly were won by thefollowing  parties: SDP 8 seats, SNSD 8 seats, SDA 7 seats, SDS 4 seats, SBB 4 seats, HDZ BiH 3 seats, SBiH 2 seats,Coration coalition HDZ 1990-HSP 2 seats, PDP 1 seat, DNS 1 seat, DNZ BiH 1 seat, and 1 seat as a compensational mandate for NSRZB."
BD,Bangladesh,41,56,33,"In Bangladesh, no direct or indirect public funding is provided to parties or candidates. Non-financial state resources were frequently abused during the most recent campaign. Some limits on contributions exist, and parties and candidates are both subject to restrictions on spending during campaigns. In spite of existing regulations on these issues, the evidence suggests that limits on both spending and donations are breached regularly. The law specifies some reporting requirements for parties and candidates, but in practice, those requirements are rarely adhered to. The Electoral Commission scans and publishes many of the incomplete reports that they receive, but that information is available only in pdf or hard copy, which makes parsing and analyzing financial reports difficult. Third party actors are present in Bangladesh. However, no laws restrict their independent political activity. The Bangladeshi Electoral Commission is charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance laws, but in practice, the agency is hamstrung by a lack of staff and budget. Despite sometimes imposing sanctions on parties and candidates that violate the legal framework, political actors continue to break the law, and concerns about the Commission's independence and efficacy persist.","Bangladesh has a unicameral parliamentary system of government.  The national parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 members elected in single member constituencies on the basis of first past the post voting.  Once a government is formed post-election, an additional 50 members appointed to so-called ""reserved"" seats after their approval by elected MPs.  For the reserved seats, candidates are nominated by the respective parties from the female party members. The reserved seats are determined proportionate to the number of seats a party has in the parliament (one reserved seat for every six seats). However, the nominated candidates have to go through a nomination process in their respective parties (submission of nomination forms, submission of information to the EC, interview etc.).

Candidates tend to manage their own funds for their electoral campaigns after being nominated by their party.  Such funds are usually made up of personal income, familial contributions, and party contributions.  At the national level, parties also run campaigns with monies raised from membership fees and business donors.

The Prime Minister is the head of government in Bangladesh, and he/she is nominated and selected by the leading party in the Jatiya Sangsad.  The ruling party also nominates a President, who is then elected by MPs to serve as the ceremonial head of state.

According to the Constitution [Article 48 (3)], the President possesses the authority of the appointment of the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice. For exercising any other function the President has to consult the Prime Minister. The President also has the authority to grant pardons, reprieves and respites, and to remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by any court, tribunal or other authority [Article 49].

The most recent national elections took place in January 2014.   In this election the former main opposition party and its allies did not contest, while in more than 50% of the total constituencies one candidate was declared the winner before the election took place as other candidates were declared illegal by the EC. In the election the former ruling party, Bangladesh Awami Leaguem and its allies got elected in 82% of constituencies, while Jatiya Party got 11% of seats and other parties and individual candidates got 7% of seats."
BE,Belgium,32,39,31,"In law, Belgium provides some direct public funding for parties, though no indirect funding is available. Non-financial resources, by and large, are not abused during election campaigns. Spending during campaigns is limited, as are some forms of contribution, but loopholes exist, including a lack of restrictions on foreign donations and the absence of requirements to mandate the reporting of loans. Violations of the legal regulations pertaining to donations and spending are rare in Belgium. Reporting requirements are relatively sparse: in law, parties must report annually and after elections, while candidates are required to submit only post-election financial reports. In practice, these reports tend to contain only a partially itemized list of donors and the amounts they contribute. Accessing the financial information of political actors is difficult, as reports are only made available to the public for a 15 day period after the conclusion of elections. Further complicating matters is the fact that the information is not accessible in a machine readable format. Despite these issues, few violations of the law occurred during the May 2014 elections in Belgium. The independent activities of third party actors are not regulated by Belgian law, but such organizations have been largely absent to date, with the exception of one organization active during the local elections of 2012. A legislative committee, the Control Commission, is in charge of monitoring and enforcing political finance. As part of the legislature, it cannot be considered independent. Nevertheless, the Commission does have the legal authority to withhold public subsidies from parties it deems in violation of the law, though it rarely does so in practice. Where individual candidates are concerned, the Commission can only refer potential violators to the court system, from whom little information about sanctions is available. The Commission's lack of formal independence, and its weak powers, are seen as impediments to effective enforcement of political finance laws.","The federal Parliament consists of the Chamber of representatives and the Senate. The Chamber can be considered as the lower house, while the Senate is the upper house.

The 150 members of the Chamber are directly elected through a semi-open (flexible list) proportional system in eleven medium sized electoral districts. There is not only an inter-party competition, but also (to some extent) an intra-party competition, as the number of candidates on the lists is higher than the number of seats a party won. Candidates thus want to win as many personal votes as possible. Consequently, both parties and individual candidates set up a campaign. Therefore, campaigns and campaign funds are managed at both the party and the candidate level (e.g. a spending cap for both parties and candidates).

The Senate, on the other hand, is exclusively composed (since 2014) of representatives from the parliaments of the Regions and the parliaments of the Communities (50 members), and of senators chosen by the former (10 members). This means that the members of the Senate are elected indirectly. The number of representatives a party gets in the Senate is based on the party's electoral result in the regional/Communities' elections.

The head of government (prime minister) is not elected, but only appointed as part of the coalition bargaining process. Although the Constitution mentions the King appoints the members of the federal government, this decision is made by the negotiators of the majority parties (i.e. the party leaders).

The last federal elections were held on May 25, 2014.

'Belgium is a federal state, composed of Communities and Regions' (Constitution, article 1). Therefore, there are several other parliaments next to the federal Parliament, of which four are elected directly: the Flemish Parliament, the Parliament of the German Speaking Community, the Walloon Parliament, the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region and the Parliament of the French Speaking Community (the latter is composed of members of the Walloon and the Brussels' Parliaments)."
BG,Bulgaria,52,76,36,"Bulgaria's fairly strong legal framework on political finance is often undermined by in practice violations. Parties are entitled to state subsidies, which they usually receive, but little information on those subsidies is available to the public. Subsidized access to advertising is provided for in the law. However, in contravention of the law, some parties are charged higher rates for campaign spots than others. Non-financial state resources, in practice, featured during the 2013 campaign. Contributions are highly restricted in Bulgaria, as is electoral spending. Nevertheless, in practice, many violations of these limits occurred during the 2013 elections, and parties often find ways by which to circumvent the formal system. Parties are required to report their financial information both within and outside of campaigns, but do not always do in practice, nor do they provide complete lists of their contributors. Further, in practice, financial information is not always available to the public. The independent activities of third party actors are not regulated, and some parties use informally affiliated groups to undertake political activities during campaigns. The National Audit Office (NAO) is the oversight authority charged with monitoring political finance, but it lacks the explicit legal power to investigate potential violations. The independence and efficacy of the NAO is somewhat compromised due to deficits of independence and merit regarding its appointees. That said, it has sufficient capacity to carry out its functions, and does sanction parties who fail to comply with reporting requirements. Nevertheless, repeat violators are frequent. The evidence suggests that, because of the fashion in which many ostensibly independent institutions, including the NAO, are compromised by political influence, equitable enforcement of political finance in Bulgaria is lacking.","Bulgaria is a parliamentary system with a unicameral legislature and a directly elected head of state. 

The National Assembly is elected through a proportional electoral system by which 240 MPs elected in 31 electoral districts. Since the 2014 parliamentary election a preference was introduced, where voters could either choose only a party and its pre-determined list, or choose a party and then pick a specific person from the list. The most recent elections took place on October 5th, 2014. 

The President is directly elected as head of state every 5 years. The most recent election took place October 2011. 

Bulgaria has been changing its electoral system in the past few years introducing a majoritarian vote for one of the seats in each of the 31 districts, but this worked against the party which introduced it (BSP) and was later abolished."
BO,Bolivia,30,41,25,"Bolivia's political finance regime, due to recent reforms, does not include direct public funding for political parties or candidates. Political advertising is regulated by the electoral authority, which assures free, equitable access to public media advertising slots for all electoral competitors. Non-financial state resources are frequently abused in Bolivia, especially by MAS, the current ruling party. Very few legal restrictions on contribution and expenditure exist: spending during campaigns is not capped, while limits on individual and corporate donations apply only to contributions to parties. In consequence, parties and candidates are largely privately funded, though MAS avails itself of public resources, legally and illegally, on a regular basis. Reporting requirements mandate that parties submit detailed pre and post election reports on their finances, as well as annual reports. Candidates are under no such obligations. In practice, party reports are quite detailed, and include an itemized list of contributions and contributors. None of that information, however, is made available to the public in any format. As a result, the media does not use official political finance data in its reporting. The independent political activities of third party vehicles, such as social organizations and groups of public employees, are not regulated, despite their presence in the electoral landscape. The Bolivian oversight authority, the Electoral Court (TSE), has no explicit investigatory powers in law. Appointments to that body are supposed to be independent and merit-based, but the MPT evidence suggests that they are often, in practice, compromised. The TSE does not investigate potential violations of political finance laws, but it can and does penalize parties for failing to submit their financial reports in the prescribed format. Because the TSE is subordinated to MAS, enforcement is highly uneven.","Bolivia is a presidential republic with a bicameral legislature. The President is directly elected by the people if he/she obtains a majority of the votes cast in the first round or if he/she wins 40% of the vote and beats the nearest opponent by 10%. Otherwise, the top two candidates compete in a second round run-off election. Campaign funds are jointly managed by parties and candidates.

The Plurinational Legislative Assembly is composed of two houses, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies contains 130 seats: 63 members are elected in single-member districts in first-past-the-post voting, 60 seats are elected via closed-list proportional representation in nine departmental districts, and 7 members are elected in single-member districts in special """"indigenous"""" constituencies. The deputies seats are awarded using the additional member system, which means that the list seats are awarded based on the total list (or presidential) vote, but after taking into account the seats won in the first-past-the-post voting.  But that process does not include in the special indigenous seats, which stand apart.

The Senate has 36 members, 4 from each department, and all of whom are elected in a closed-list proportional representation system. Deputies and Senators serve five year terms. Legislative campaigns are managed at the party level. Candidates must run as representatives of a party ticket; candidates cannot run as independents and parties must contest all seats in the general election.

Presidential and legislative elections are held concurrently, and the list-proportional vote (for both chambers) is the presidential vote. The most recent elections occurred in 2009. In 2009, the incumbent Evo Morales won 64% of the vote and his MAS party elected 88 deputies and 26 senators. The now-defunct PPB party took 26% of the vote and elected 37 deputies and 10 senators. Two smaller parties, UN and AS, elected 3 and 2 deputies each, respectively. New elections were held in October of 2014."
BR,Brazil,54,76,47,"Brazil, in law and in practice, provides a good deal of direct public funding to parties during campaigns. Indirect funding, in the form of free access to advertising on public and private media, is equitably provided to both parties and candidates. Non-financial state resources, in spite of a ban on their use during campaigns, are often deployed for electoral gain. With the exception of cash donations, most forms of contribution are subject to a limit, but expenditure is essentially uncapped, as parties are supposed to set and adhere to their own unique spending limits. This leads to a situation in which parties stipulate extremely high spending limits that enable huge amounts of campaign expenditures. Limits on contributions are often contravened in practice. In law, parties are subject to extensive reporting requirements, and candidates are supposed to report detailed information during campaigns. In practice, political actors often fail to comply with these requirements, and many reports omit contributions. Submitted reports are made available online, but not all are in standardized, machine readable formats. Violations of political finance laws, including vote buying, were frequent during the 2010 elections. The independent activities of third party actors are not regulated, and many such organizations actively participate in campaigning. The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) is charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance laws, and in practice, the TSE is mostly independent, with appointments made based on merit. It has limited capacity due to the scope of its work, but still carries out investigations into violations, and imposes sanctions on violators. However, only some of these sanctions are complied with, and violations continue to occur.","Brazil is led by a directly elected President, and also has a bicameral Parliament.  The President is elected by majority vote in a two round system, and is the head of state.

Members of the lower house of Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, are elected in a proportional system to four year terms.  There are 513 seats in the chamber, and they're allocated proportionally between the 27 states according to each state's population.  The number of seats for electoral districts varies between 8 and 70, with seats allocated according to an open list system: parties put forward a list of candidates in no order of preference and voters may vote for a party (legenda) or for a candidate (nominal). Votes are totalled in each electoral district, with nominal plus legenda votes determining the distribution of seats among the parties; the candidates of each party receiving the most votes take up the number of seats won by their party.

The 81 members of the Federal Sentate are elected on a majority basis to eight year terms.  The 81 Senate seats are made up of three members for each state and the Federal District. Senators are elected by simple majority for an eight-year term. Part of the Senate is renewed at each election, (two-thirds in one election, one-third in the next election).

Parties and individual candidates both play a role in the management of campaigns and electoral funds.

The most recent elections were held in October 2010, and new elections will occur later this year.

 In the 2010 presidential elections, Dilma Rousseff of the Worker's Party (PT) was elected president. The leftist PT elected 86 federal deputies, while center PMDB elected 78, opposition party PSDB elected 54, minor coalition member PP 44, and nine other parties elected more than 10 deputies, making this a very fragmented Chamber of Deputies."
BW,Botswana,18,23,13,"In the main, political finance is unregulated in Botswana. No direct or indirect mechanisms of public funding exist, and non-financial state resources are regularly abused during campaigns. Restrictions on contribution and expenditure exist, but are so outdated that the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has not enforced them for many years. According to the law, candidates are supposed to report their financial information after campaigns, but in practice, no such reporting occurs, as the IEC also declines to enforce these provisions. The political actions of third party actors are not at all regulated. The IEC is weak, and plays little role in the enforcement of political finance laws.","Botswana has national elections for Parliament and an indirectly elected head of state. Fifty seven (57) of the 63 members are elected by direct popular vote in single-member constituencies using the first-past-the-post otherwise known as simple majority system.  Four (4) are appointed by the majority party, and 2 (the President and Attorney-General) are ex-officio members. After general election, the party that wins the majority elects its President. The President then appoints the Vice President and Ministers to head the different government ministries.  Members of Parliament serve 5-year terms.

While Botswana Parliament is unicameral, it is often understood as a bicameral system. This is so because Botswana Parliament has a structure called The House of Chiefs. This structure however does not have the powers to make laws. The House of Chiefs is just an advisory body. It can advise the National Assembly on constitutional, customary and land issues only.

Because there are no laws governing party funding or campaign funding, political parties are free to raise their funds and distribute the funds to its candidates as they wish. The members are also allowed to raise funds separately from the party structures. Campaign funds are managed at both party and candidate level. 

The most recent election took place on 16 October 2009, with the previous on 30 October 2004. On 24 October 2014 the next election will take place."
CL,Chile,66,82,55,"Chile has a strong system of direct and indirect public funding for parties and candidates. In law and practice, public resources are provided equitably and in accordance with legally defined mechanisms. Documented cases of the abuse of non-financial resources during the 2013 elections are rare. Restrictions on contribution and expenditure exist, but loopholes are present within the system. Some forms of anonymous contributions, for example, are permitted. Campaign spending, by both parties and candidates, is limited to a maximum amount. In practice, the evidence indicates that some of the legal restrictions were violated during 2013, and some expenditures may have exceeded the specified limits. Legally established reporting requirements are fairly sparse in Chile - post election reports are required of all political actors, and parties must submit annual reports. In practice, reports usually omit at least some contributors. Incomplete reports and a dearth of standardization mean that, in practice, limited information is available to the public. In law, third party actors are prohibited from engaging in independent political activities. Nevertheless, in practice, some organizations do conduct such activities. The Electoral Service is charged with oversight of political finance, and its leaders are typically independent and appointed, at least in part, based on merit. The Electoral Service has sufficient staff and budget to carry out its responsibilities, but it does not publish information on its investigation results. It can and does impose some sanctions, but equitable enforcement is incomplete, and accusations of dark money continue to pervade Chilean politics.","Chile is a presidential republic with a bicameral parliament.  The President is the head of state and the head of government, and is directly elected every four years in a two round voting process.  If no candidate receives an absolute majority of the votes cast in the first round, the top two candidates then participate in a run off election.  The responsiblity for managing campaign funds in presidential races is shared between parties and candidates.

The legislature is composed of 38 senators and 120 deputies, all of whom are elected based on proportional representation in a binomial system.  Senators serve 8 year terms, and deputies have 4 year terms.  Two members of each house of parliament are elected in each of Chile's electoral districts--there are 19 senatorial districts and 60 districts for deputies.  Candidate nominations are made according to party lists.  For each house, each list proposes two candidates for each district.  In the case of independent lists, only one candidate is presented.  The candidate who is elected is from the list with the most votes, the largest vote winner, and the second elected candidate is from the second most popular list.  One exception to this is that, when the first list receives twice as many votes as the second list, both seats will be granted to the first list.

Parties and candidates both manage campaign funds.

Presidential and elections for the Chamber of Deputies occur every four years, and half of the Senate is elected at each four year cycle.  The most recent elections were held in 2013.

The 2013 election was an important test for the Chilean political system, since more than 6 million citizens went to exercise their right to vote, but this time voluntarily. This choice not only voted for candidates for president and parliament, but also for the first time, regional councilors voted for. 
The results of the elections showed that the candidate in the first round of the New Majority and opposition Michelle Bachelet won a vote of 46.67% (21% more than the candidate Evelyn Matthei, official candidate), then placed the PRO candidate Marco Enríquez-Ominami with 10.98% and then peered six other candidates who obtained 17.3%. 
In this sense, during the ballotaje figures were much more diverse, in fact, the representative of the New Majority candidate got a 62.17% support against a 37.83% of the candidate Evelyn Matthei.

Furthermore, the distribution of forces within the parliament, significantly favoring the members of the New Majority, as they reached 67 seats of the 120 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies; and 21 of the 38 seats in the Senate. In this context the distribution percentages of the Chamber of Deputies are 40.8% to 55.8% Alliance and the New Majority and 3.4% for independent candidates."
CO,Colombia,65,84,61,"There is a strong legal framework in place in Colombia to regulate political finance issues. Systems of direct and indirect public funding exist, and are equitably enforced in practice. Non-financial resources are occasionally abused during campaigns, but such occurrences are the exception, rather than the norm. Legal restrictions on contributions are substantial, though no law restricts cash donations. Spending during election campaigns is also capped. Interestingly, in spite of the equitable provision of direct public funding, private contributions still account for the bulk of campaign expenditures. Further, violations of limits on contribution and expenditure were reported during the 2014 elections. Reporting requirements in Colombia are stringent, and largely respected in practice. Most political actors adhere to the law, and report the majority of contributions received. In practice, a good deal of political finance information is available to the public, in large part due to the use of Cuentas Claras, an online platform on which financial reports are immediately published upon submission. Violations of the regulatory framework, including vote buying, were present during the 2014 elections. Third party actors are not hugely influential in Colombia, but their independent activities are not regulated by law. The National Electoral Council (NEC) is charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance, but some appointees appear to lack the merit and independence necessary for successfully carrying out their duties. Still, the NEC investigates potential violations, and has sufficient capacity to do so, but is not totally transparent about its investigation results. The body imposes sanctions, most of which are complied with.","Colombia has national elections for a bicameral Legislature and a Presidential executive. The Congress is composed by two Chambers: Senate and House of Representatives.  Political Organizations must inscribe candidates in lists for each electoral district in which they are aspiring to be elected. The Colombian Electoral System allows political organizations to choose over two types of lists: open and closed. In closed lists, citizens choose over an unchangeable order of candidates depending on the amount of votes received. In open lists (or as it is called “with preferential vote”) citizens can vote for the candidate of their preference without regard of the position he/she has in the list or they can only vote for the political organization in which the order of the candidates matter.  

The Senate of the Republic is composed by 102 members, 100 members are elected by national constituency and two by indigenous communities, for a term of 4 years and can be reelected indefinitely. For being elected the political organization must first obtain certain number of votes to met the 3% threshold; with this minimum threshold achieved the candidates get the possibility of access to the distribution of seats.  The House of Chambers is composed by 162 members elected in representation of each one of the Colombian Departments (32) and the Capital District Bogota. The amount of seats for each department depends on its population. There are also special 5 seats given in the following way: two to Afro-Colombian communities; two more to Colombians that live abroad and one seat to Indigenous communities.   Through the D´Hondt System the electoral quotient is established to know how many seats from each list. It is calculated by dividing the number of votes for each list that exceeded the threshold between the total numbers of seats, from 1 to N, then those numbers higher N, where N is the number of seats available is chosen.  When only one seat is given the threshold is not applied and the winner is the one who gets more votes.  In districts where two seats are given the threshold is applied equivalent to the 30% of the valid votes, and for the districts where more than two seats are given a threshold of 50% of the electoral quotient is applied.

Regarding campaign financing for legislative elections, public funds are allocated and managed both by candidates as well as political organizations.  Candidates can raise contributions from private donors and also political organizations.  The last ones are also in charge of receiving the request of advanced public funds from the candidates they endorsed.  At the same time they must present the request of funds to the electoral authority.  Likewise they receive these funds and give them to the candidates that asked for them if the met the requirements established by law.    

Political Parties and Movements or Significant Groups of Citizens, that prove they are been support by a minimum number of signatures, can present candidates for presidential elections by a formula of President / Vice-president. The candidates must be Colombian by birth, be 30 years or older and exercise his/her rights as citizens. The formula President / Vice-president is elected for a term of four years and may be reelected for another single term. The electoral systems provides two rounds for presidential elections, the first is open to all the candidates.  In case no candidate receives at least half plus one of the total valid votes casted, a second round is held only with the two formulas that received the greater voting.  The winner is the candidate who receives more votes. 

The Law 996 of 2005 regulated by the Presidential Decree No. 863 of 2006 encourages state funding as the main source for funding the presidential elections.  The access of public funding is through advanced funds and also by the system of replacements of campaign costs by valid votes. These funds have to be destined for electoral propaganda and other campaign expenditures. Contributions made in cash or in kind by private individuals (no corporations) are allowed, but limited to a 2% of the maximum amount of expenditure set by the NEC. Individual contributions must not exceed the 20% of the total campaign expenditures.  The campaign funds may be managed through a specific bank account open exclusively for this purpose, where the manager of the campaign is responsible of the movements made through it.

CR,Costa Rica,71,78,68,"Costa Rica has a strong legal framework in place to regulate political finance. Direct public funding is provided (in the form of post-election reimbursements), in law and in practice, to political parties, and the abuse of non-financial state resources during campaigns is rare. There is no subsidized or free access to media advertising during campaigns. There is no limit on contributions from individuals, nor are cash donations prohibited or capped. Campaign spending is also unlimited. In practice, this means that parties take out substantial loans to finance campaigns, which they later pay down with the reimbursements provided by the state. Reporting requirements are quite stringent, the law mandating that parties submit detailed financial reports both inside and outside election periods. In general, parties typically complied with these requirements during the 2014 election. The reports are made available to the public, but not in a standardized or machine readable format. Violations of the law were rare during the 2014 campaign. Third party actors are prohibited from engaging in any political activity, but in practice, several ostensibly independent, non-party organizations undertook campaign activities in 2014. The Electoral Court (TSE) oversees political finance. Appointments to the TSE are merit-based, though not public, and its leaders are independent, both in law and in practice. The authority is only slightly constrained by a lack of budget and staff capacity, and carries out investigations when warranted in most cases, though it does not publish all investigation results in a timely fashion. The TSE imposes fines and refers cases for prosecution when necessary, and offenders comply with its sanctions. Despite the strengths of the Costa Rican system, weaknesses remain: in particular, the failure to regulate contributions from individuals, and the lack of a cap on spending during campaigns, have been the subject of reform efforts.","In Costa Rica, the elected President is the Head of State.  Presidential candidates must receive at least 40% of the national vote in order to assume office in the first round of voting; if no candidate achieves this percentage, a runoff election between the top two candidates is held to determine the winner (the second time being elected by the simple majority of the voters).  Presidents are elected to four year terms, and may not be reelected to consecutive terms.  The most recent presidential elections were held in February (first round) and April (second round) of 2014, and were won by Luis Guillermo Solís of the Acción Ciudadana political party (PAC). Campaign funds and presidential campaigns are a monopoly of political parties. 

The unicameral legislature, referred to as the Legislative Assembly, is composed of 57 members elected by proportional representation in 7 multi-member constituencies.  Candidates run on closed party lists. Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to 4 year terms, and may not hold office for consecutive terms. The most recent parliamentary elections were held concurrently with the first round of the presidential elections in February 2014.  The Liberación Nacional political party (PLN) took 18 seats after receiving 25% of the vote, followed by the PAC with 13 seats (24% of the vote), the Frente Amplio party with 9 seats (13%) and the Unidad Social Cristiana Party with 8 seats (10%) of the vote, with a variety of other parties obtaining the remaining seats. There are also no independent candidates for Legislative seats.

In Costa Rica, the financing of the elections relies on a mixed system of both public and private contribution. The public contribution works retroactively as a reimbursement, but a percentage of the funds can be accessed in advance by offering collateral warranties and there is a final liquidation of the public debt or the execution of the warranty depending on whether the political party reached or not the minimum requirements established by the Political Constitution for public support. The private funding is subject to transparency and reporting controls. It is not customary that the candidate contributes to the campaign, although there is no legal prohibition to do so, since all individual contributions are channeled to the political party through the Treasury."
DE,Germany,40,43,50,"Germany's lightly regulated political finance system provides direct public funding for parties and candidates, but full information on exactly when disbursements are made is not available to the public. During elections, parties are granted free access to advertising, both in law and in practice. During the 2013 elections, some parliamentary groups, in contravention of the law, deployed their parliamentary staff in campaign events. Contributions are largely unrestricted, and there is no spending limit during campaigns. Nevertheless, parties appear to rely primarily on state funding and members' fees, while corporate and private donations are less important. Reporting requirements are scant, as only parties are required to submit any financial information -- according to the law, they are supposed to do so annually. Contributions listed on those reports are not itemized, and may not be complete. Received reports are published on the parliamentary website, but are usually in pdf format, and are often quite out of date. Third party actors, including unions and party foundations, are politically active, but are not subject to any regulation. The responsibility for oversight of political finance is split between the President of the Bundestag and the Federal Audit Office. Though the FAO is generally independent, the President of the Bundestag is a political figure. The two bodies generally have the capacity to carry out their duties, but investigations into potential violations are rare, and no information on those investigations is released to the public in a timely fashion. Sanctions are imposed when necessary, but repeat offenders are frequent. Germany's relatively weak legal framework and the opacity of its system, as well as the lack of a strong independent monitoring authority, inhibit the strength and transparency of enforcement.","Germany is a parliamentary republic that consists of a federal government, which and 16 federal states (federal system). It has a bicameral legislature, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. 

Members of the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament, are elected by in a mixed system.  Half of the members are directly elected by their constituencies in a first past the post system, and the other half are elected via proportional representation through closed party lists in each of the 16 states.  The number of seats allocated to each of the 16 states is calculated on the proportion of the German population that lives in each state, and seats are then allocated on the basis of proportion of the votes received in each state by each party.  

The Bundestag members are the only federal officials directly elected by the public; the Bundestag in turn elects the head of state (the Chancellor) and, in addition, exercises oversight of the executive branch on issues of both substantive policy and routine administration. This check on executive power can be employed through binding legislation, public debates on government policy, investigations, and direct questioning of the chancellor or cabinet officials. In theory the Bundestag consists of parliamentary party groups (Fraktionen) and independent candidates, although independent candidates are a very rare exception. 

The most recent elections in Germany occurred on September, 22nd, 2013, the next one being scheduled for 2017. The current Bundestag consists of 504 seats for political party groups within Government and 127 seats within Opposition, namely:

Government (504)
     CDU (255)
     SPD (193)
     CSU (56)

Opposition (127)
     LINKE (64)
     GRÜNE (63)

Norbert Lammert is the current President of the Bundestag. The President of the Bundestag is member of Parliament and elected by members of Parliament. The President of Bundestag and the Presidium of the Bundestag are responsible for the routine administration of the Bundestag and is one of the two oversight authority for financing and reporting of political parties and members of parliament. The other one being the Federal Audit Office (Bundesrechungshof).

The head of State is the President, which is elected by a specially convened federal convention consisting of the entire Bundestag (the lower house of Parliament) and representatives of the federal states that are chosen by state level parliaments.  The President's role is largely ceremonial.

Real power is concentrated in the office of the Chancellor (currently Angela Merkel), who is officially the head of Government, and is elected by the members of the Bundestag.  

The German Bundesrat represents the sixteen federal states of Germany at the national level. Members of the Bundesrat, the upper house, are selected from regional legislatures, and are not popularly elected at the national level.

For both houses of parliament, elections are funded through parties. For the Bundesrat, most funds are channeled through local party branches."
EC,Ecuador,65,73,40,"Ecuador provides parties with direct public funding; however, they may not use those funds for campaign purposes. Access to advertising, on the other hand, is available, though it was not distributed transparently and equitably during the 2014 campaign. Non-financial resources were regularly abused during that campaign as well. Restrictions on contributions from individuals and corporations exist in the law, but no ban limits cash contributions. Expenditures during campaigns, however, are capped. Numerous violations of these restrictions occurred during the most recent elections. Where reporting is concerned, parties are required to submit reports both inside and outside campaigns. In practice, submitted reports include complete lists of all contributors, but none of that information is available to the public in a timely fashion. Third party actors are prohibited from any political activity, and the evidence suggests that Ecuador is one of the few countries in the MPT sample in which such organizations have not had any campaign presence. The National Electoral Council (NEC) is responsible for oversight of political finance, but its appointees, in practice, are neither fully merit-based nor independent. A lack of budget and staff complicates its ability to carry out its remit, and the public cannot easily access information on the NEC's investigations. The body does impose sanctions, but offenders do not always comply. According to the MPT research, a lack of transparency on political finance information in general and the NEC's work in particular inhibits the efficacy of Ecuador's regulatory regime.","Ecuador has a directly elected President who serves as the head of state, while the legislative branch consists of the unicameral 137 member National Assembly. Members of the National Assembly are elected on the basis of a proportional representation system. 15 members are elected in a single national district, two members are elected for each province, plus one additional member for every 200,000 inhabitants, or the fraction thereof over 150,000 (during the most recent elections, 116 members were elected in provincial party lists), and six members are elected for the special foreign districts representing Ecuadorians living abroad. Only legally recognized political organizations may present candidates for elections.

Direct non-electoral public funding is provided for political parties. Candidates can collect resources on their own, but campaign financial accounts are managed by a financial manager designated by party organizations. The manager is exclusively responsible for keeping records and presenting reports to the National Electoral Council. When parties present several lists for multi-member elections, the financial manager must present reports for each lists separately. Individual candidates can self-finance only 10% of the total expenditure authorized by the National Electoral Council.

To guarantee equal and fair access to electoral promotion for all candidates during the campaign, indirect electoral public funding is available. Public financing covers exclusively propaganda in the written press, radio, television and billboards. Candidates are forbidden to hire these types of electoral promotion privately, and public institutions are barred from hiring publicity. The National Electoral Council determines the amount of the electoral bonus that each candidate will receive and monitors expenditures. Campaign funds for presidential candidates are managed by a financial manager, who is required to open a bank account in the national financial system in order to track down campaign expenditures specifically.

The President and Vice President are elected by an absolute majority of the valid votes.  If no candidate secures an absolute majority in the first round of voting, a second round shall be held within 45 days, and the two candidates with the highest number of votes in the first round shall participate. A second round will not be held if one candidate wins at least 40% of the valid votes and a difference of more than 10 percentage points over his nearest challenger.  

The most recent general elections were held in February 2013, when President Rafael Correa of the Alianza PAIS movement was re-elected in the first round of voting with 57.17% of the vote. The runner up candidate was Guillermo Lasso, representing the CREO movement, with 22.68%, with the remaining of the votes being distributed among other six candidates. In the legislative elections, Correa’s Alianza PAIS took 100 of the 137 seats, thus obtaining an overwhelming majority. The other political forces that won seats in the legislature are: CREO (11), the Social Christian Party (6), Patriotic Society (5), Avanza (5), Unity of the Lefts (5), PRE (1), SUMA (1), IDC (1), ARE (1), and MPCG (1)."
GB,United Kingdom,52,39,76,"The United Kingdom has a strong framework in place to regulate political finance, and enforcement is equally strong. Direct public funding is provided to parties, and it appears to be distributed equitably. However, those funds cannot be used during campaigns. Indirect public funding, in the form of free access to broadcast media, is also provided to parties. In practice, that airtime is given out fairly and transparently. Parties are not permitted to independently purchase airtime or otherwise advertise on television during campaigns. Relevant legislation restricts few forms of contribution, but spending during campaigns is capped for both parties and independent candidates. Based on data from the 2010 elections, parties did not even approach the spending limits codified in law. Parties, by law, must report on their finances regularly, both inside and outside campaigns. Independent candidates must do so only after the campaign period, while regulated donees (defined as members of registered parties, including members of parliament and candidates) have to regularly report on contributions received every month. In practice, most parties, candidates, and donees comply with these requirements, and most submit detailed lists of their contributors, though some exceptions exist. The UK Electoral Commission regularly publishes submitted political finance information online in a searchable database. Third party actors are active in UK elections, and those that spend in excess of a certain amount on independent campaign activities are required to report on their political activities. This means that some, though not all, third party organizations are subject to regulations, and that some, though not all, data on their expenditures is publicly available. The Electoral Commission oversees political finance. Its commissioners are typically appointed on merit, and their independence is, by and large, guaranteed. The Commission carried out multiple investigations in the wake of the 2010 elections, and imposed administrative sanctions, most of which were complied with. In general, the enforcement of political finance in the UK has greatly improved since reforms instituted in 2009.","The United Kingdom has a bicameral parliamentary system, with a Prime Minister as the head of government, and a monarch as the technical head of state.  The House of Commons is the lower house of Parliament, and is composed of 650 members, each of which represents a single constituency and is selected on the basis of first-past-the-post voting.  The Prime Minister is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Commons, and is appointed by the sitting monarch.

In the 2010 election no clear majority government was elected. As such a coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, the third largest party in the UK, was formed. The prime minister is the Conservative David Cameron, and the Deputy Prime Minister is the Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats.

The Conservative Party won 307 seats in the election, and the Liberal Democrats 57. This gave them a combined majority in parliament with 364 seats of 650. The Labour party formed the opposition with 258 seats.  

The House of Lords, the upper house, has 779 members, none of whom are directly elected.  Most are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, or on the advice of the House of Lords Appointments Commission. The House of Lords scrutinises bills proposed by the commons and has the power to amend them. It can only in rare circumstances prevent bills from becoming law, though can delay the passage of a bill to force the House of Commons to reconsider the legislation.

Electoral campaigns are funded and managed by both parties and candidates.  In the run up to the last general election in May 2010, parties spent a total of approximately £31.5 million (USD 53.0 million).  In the month between the dissolvement of Parliament and voting day, candidate spending amounted to  £14.0 million (USD 23.6 million)."
GE,Georgia,79,93,63,"Georgia has a robust political finance system, as illustrated by its adherence to laws that distribute both direct and indirect public funding to parties and candidates. That said, during the 2012 and 2013 elections, non-financial state resources, including staff, were prevalently abused for electoral benefit. In law, there are limits or prohibitions on contributions from foreign sources, individuals, third parties, and corporations, and electoral expenditures are capped. Nevertheless, larger parties are still quite reliant on private donations, and illegal contributions occurred frequently during recent elections. Reporting requirements for both parties and candidates are fairly strict, and reports submitted by both types of actors typically include all of their contributors. All submitted information is published online in pdf (i.e., non machine readable) formats. Third party actors, which feature somewhat prominently in Georgian politics, are subject to reporting requirements, though not all such organizations act within the bounds of the law when conducting their activities. The State Audit Office (SAO) is charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance laws, but its ability to do so equitably is weakened by in practice deficiencies where its appointees' merit and independence are concerned. The SAO does not have the staff to carry out investigations when warranted, and though it imposes sanctions on violators, it is unable to comprehensively police financial flows during campaigns. According to experts, improvements in the competence and independence of the SAO are necessary for enhancing the quality of enforcement.","Georgia has a unicameral legislature with a  directly elected head of state. The Parliament of Georgia consists of 77 members elected by a proportional voting system and 73 members elected by a majoritarian voting system (FPTP) in single mandate constituencies.

The President of Georgia is the Head of the State of Georgia, elected through universal, equal, and direct suffrage by secret ballot for a term of five years. The most recent Presidential Elections took place on October 27, 2013 and most recent Parliamentary Elections took place on October 1, 2012.

Campaign funds are managed on the party level and a candidate nominated by an electoral subject (party or coalition) shall use the fund of the electoral subject nominating the candidate. Individual candidate's funds are managed through the fund opened by an initiative group of voters. 

Specifically:
a) Party funds the campaign if the party independently participates in the election/referendum;
b) the first party on the list of an electoral bloc (coalition) funds and manages funding if political unions come together as one electoral subject;
c) the election funds opened by an initiative group of voters are used to fund and manage funding of the campaign of an independent (individual) candidate.

Political parties receive public funding only if they are ""qualified"" subjects, having gained a specific number of votes in previous elections. Independent candidates may get their electoral campaign costs reimbursed after the election if they gather a certain number of votes. 

Currently there is an ongoing reform working on amending the electoral system of Parliament. Specifically, it is considered that the system is not providing equal vote weight to all voters, since Majoritarian Districts in Georgian FPTP system are distributed according to the existing municipalities, which have different number of voters. Therefore, voters from one district can have a vote-weight up to 27 times more than voters from another district."
GH,Ghana,26,36,22,"Ghana does not provide parties or candidates with funding, direct or indirect, for electoral campaigning.

Due to the absence of most regulations, no violations of restrictions were reported during the 2012 elections. Parties are required to report their financial information within and without the campaign season, but in practice, it is not uncommon for them to fail to meet these requirements. Of the information that is submitted, it often fails to include a full list of contributors. Financial reports are not made accessible to the public in a timely fashion. There is no regulation of third party actors in the Ghanaian system. The oversight body, the Electoral Commission, is generally independent, though some of its leaders may have been appointed on a non-merit-basis. In practice, however, the Electoral Commission exercises very little control of political finance. It has not investigated or audited party accounts within the study period due to a lack of capacity, nor has it sanctioned any party for violating the law (despite the fact that several violations have occurred).","Elections to Ghana’s single chamber parliament are based on a plurality-majority system:  a simple majority is sufficient to win election. Each member of parliament represents one of 275 single-member electoral districts. Individual candidates mobilize and spend funds during the campaign. Political parties raise and spend additional funds, particularly to coordinate campaigns across the country.
 
In order to win presidential elections, a candidate must secure 50 percent plus one of valid votes cast. If no candidate meets this threshold a run-off is organized between the two leading candidates within 21 days of the first round. Similar to parliamentary elections, both individual candidates and parties raise and spend funds for presidential campaigns.
 
Parliamentary and presidential elections are highly competitive and occur every four years. While independents and candidates from a number of other parties compete in elections, only two parties have won the presidency or secured a majority in parliament since the return to multi-party democracy in 1992. The last elections occurred in December 2012."
HR,Croatia,62,78,63,"Croatia provides public subsidies for parties and candidates during campaigns, both in law and in practice. No indirect funding in the form of subsidized access to media exists, and the evidence indicates that non-financial public resources, including ministry vehicles, were occasionally abused in recent elections. The legal framework restricts many types of contributions and also caps the amount that can be spent during election campaigns. As a result, public funding comprises a huge chunk of party budgets. Few, if any, of the legal limits were violated in the 2014 elections. Parties and candidates are subject to strict legal reporting requirements, the majority of which are complied with in practice. Submitted financial reports are available online, but not in a machine-readable format. Despite these successes, the 2014 elections were marred by numerous violations of political finance laws. Further, no law exists to regulate the independent activities of third party actors during campaigns, even though at least one actor (a football team) engaged in partisan political action during the 2014 campaign. The State Election Committee (SEC) oversees political finance issues. Appointments to the SEC are not merit-based, but the body is at least somewhat independent in practice. It has sufficient capacity to pursue its remit, and regularly investigates potential violations of political finance. However, the SEC lacks the legal authority to impose sanctions, and experts report that this weakens the strength of enforcement in Croatia.","Croatia has a unicameral parliament with a directly elected head of state. The President of Croatia is elected at direct elections, and to become a president candidate must win majority of votes from voters who voted (system of the absolute majority). If no candidate won absolute majority, then elections are repeated in 14 days. In the second round, only 2 candidates who won majority of votes in the first round can compete for the position. 

Croatian electoral system faced many changed from 1990 onwards, and as of 1999 Croatia has proportional electoral system for parliamentary elections with 10 proportional electoral entities (with 2 entities in special status), each with 14 mandates in Croatian Parliament. One voter has one vote, and votes are being calculated to mandates using D'Hondt procedure.

Campaigns are funded by Government and through donations and funds parties have at their disposal through various activities. Government is granting funding to all parties and independent representatives/candidates providing they meet minimal threshold for entering the Parliament. All funding that parties/independent candidates receive must be fully reported and made publicly available. 

The most recent elections in Croatia were:
May 2014 - European elections
May 2013 - Local elections
April 2013 - European elections
December 2011 - parliamentary elections
December 2009 - Presidential elections"
HU,Hungary,38,47,42,"In Hungary, direct public funding is provided to parties and candidates, both in law and in practice. However, the agency in charge of making disbursements of state funds does not release detailed information on those payments to the public. Hungarian legislation also mandates that parties be allocated equitable access to advertising on public media, but this is not borne out in practice. Further, non-financial state resources are regularly abused during election campaigns, especially by the ruling part, Fidesz. Electoral spending is capped at a maximum limit, but restrictions on contribution are not as stringent. Cash and anonymous donations are permitted, and there is no limit on donations from individuals. State funds make up the largest chunk of parties' budgets, but other income streams, including private donations, are important. Financial reporting is required only after campaigns and, for parties, annually. In practice, parties and candidates fail to submit full reports on their contributors. Obtaining these reports is difficult for citizens, though journalists and civil society actors have accessed official data in their work. Third party actors are not especially prevalent in the electoral landscape, but those that do exist are not subject to any regulatory requirements. The two authorities in charge of overseeing political finance, the State Audit Office (SAO) and the State Treasury, are staffed by appointees who are not appointed in fully public, merit-based processes. In practice, the independence of the SAO is not fully guaranteed. The SAO does have the capacity to monitor political finance, and carried out some audits after the 2014 elections. However, the SAO does not have the authority to impose sanctions, and those enacted by the State Treasury, which monitors the use of state funding, are too weak to deter violators.","Hungary has a unicameral legislature in which Parliament is composed of 199 representatives. 106 of the representatives are elected in single-member constituencies through majoritarian contests, and 93 are distributed through a proportional system with a 5% threshold for parties receiving seats. 

The election is a one-round elenction where every eligible person cast his/her vote on a candidate of his/her single-member constituency and one party list (a list of the party with the intended representatives on it). 

In the single-member constituencies the candidate with the most votes will be the MP.

In the proportional system not only the directly cast votes are calculated, but a party get the votes of all his losing candidates in the single-member constituencies plus all the superfluous votes from its winning candidates. (This is a system of two contrary mechanism: The losing candidates carry over their votes as compensating votes in order to help their party to get into the Parliament and helping a more equal representation, while the winning candidates carry over their votes to support their parties majority, thus providing more to the stable governing. The superfluous votes are all the unnecessary votes of the victory, thus every vote above the candidate with the second most votes plus 1.) 

Another unique attribute of the electoral system is the votes of Hungarians with double citizenship. In the surrounding countires many Hungarian live as an ethnic group and they have the opportunity to apply for a Hungarian citizenship via simplified process. They can only vote for a list, but due to the number of these votes they can decide about 1 or 2 mandates. (In the results they appear as voting by postal ballot.)

The Prime Minister is the head of government, and is nominated for the position by the President, subject to election by Parliament.  The most recent elections occurred in April of 2014.
  
Parliamentary elections are primarily funded by the state, as the candidates receive 1 million HUF for their campaign expenditures, while the parties receive funding based on how many candidates they have in the single-member constituencies. The campaign expenditures are capped at 5 million HUF per candidate, so each party can use its own resources to spend more than the state support.

The President is the official head of state with middle-strong powers.  Parliament elects the president every five years. Its role in the elections can be crucial, as he asks the leader of one of the parties to form government and can choose any leader. Although in the past it was always clear which party has the highest chance to form a stable government, this power can become essential in a tight result.

The 2014 elections were the first one after enacting the new acts on the process of elections, thus it was interesting to see how the new rules influence the political activities and the power relations of the parties. As the result of the elections, the ruling coalition maintained its absolute majority in the Parliament, the Fidesz-KDNP got 133 seats from the available 199. The second most seats was obtained by the alliance of five parties (MSZP, Együtt, DK, PM and MLP) with 38 seats, while the Jobbik received 23 seats. The smallest party that got into the Parliament was LMP with 5 seats.

During the elections many flaws of the current regulation materialized, and the higher number of political parties did not lead to a more diverse Parliament.

As as sidenote the ethnicities also have the chance to delegate a representative to the Parliament. Members of ethnicities can opt for voting for their ethnic list instead of a party list, and if the given ethnicity achieve a calculated quota they can have a representative with vote in the Parliament. If they do not achieve the quota they can send a representative without vote to the Parliament."
ID,Indonesia,47,65,47,"Indonesia's political finance framework makes public funding available for parties, and is distributed according to how many votes were received during the previous election. In practice, obtaining information on how much funding parties received is nearly impossible, as doing so requires filing information requests with parties themselves. Parties and candidates are also granted free access to public media during campaigns; however, in practice, some parties are granted more coverage than others. Further, non-financial state resources are regularly abused during campaigns. Cash contributions are not regulated and though limits cap the amount an individual can donate to presidential candidates and to parties, contributions to members of parliament are not restricted. Corporate donations are limited, and third party actors are not permitted to make direct contributions to campaigns. Spending during campaigns is not capped. Nevertheless, the MPT evidence indicates that actual spending during the campaign season far outstrips the figures reported by parties. Reporting requirements are not comprehensive, and of the reports that are submitted in practice, most fail to include a complete list of contributors. Detailed information on the financial data of political actors is largely unavailable to the public. Third party actors exert influence during campaigns, but as their independent political activities are not regulated by law, little information on their actions is available. The responsibility for enforcing political finance laws is split between two agencies: KPU and Bawaslu. KPU monitors political finance information, and when necessary, refers cases to Bawaslu for investigation. Only KPU can legally impose sanctions, though its powers are limited. Both agencies are independent, with appointees possessing sufficient merit for their positions, but lack the capacity to completely carry out their functions. In practice, Bawaslu does conduct investigations transparently, and KPU does impose sanctions, but violations continue to occur. The KPU's sanctioning authority is limited to administrative fines, and is too weak to deter repeat violators. The limited authority of the oversight bodies hamstrings their ability to meaningfully enforce many political finance regulations.","Indonesia has a presidential executive system in which the head of state (the president) is directly elected.  Parties or coalitions which hold at least 25% of the seats in parliament, or who enjoy 20% of the popular vote, nominate presidential candidates, who manage their own funds during the electoral campaigns.

In the bicameral legislature, the lower house, known as the House of Representatives (DPR), is elected on the basis of a proportional, open-list party system.  Parties nominate several candidates in a given constituency, and candidates receiving the most votes take office.  There are 560 members  elected from 77 electoral regions. The number of lawmakers vary from one electoral region to the next depending on the population of each region. The decision to divide the electoral regions and determine the number of lawmakers per region is in the hands of the General Elections Commission (KPU).  For example, Jakarta, the Indonesian capital and the biggest city in the country is divided into three electoral regions because of its population size with a total number of lawmakers of 21, But the sparsely populated West Papua province only has one electoral region with just 3 lawmakers despite its size. Meanwhile West Java, the biggest province by population is divided into 10 electoral regions with a total of 91 lawmakers.   Campaigns are managed and funded largely at the party level.

There are 132 senators at the Regional Representatives Council (DPD), or Senate, representing 33 provinces except the newly established province of North Kalimantan. Each province has four senators that are elected on the basis of being the top four vote recipients in a given province.. individual candidates can run.  Candidates manage their own campaign funds.  

Legislative elections and presidential elections are held separately.  The most recent legislative elections occurred in April 2014, and the most recent presidential elections were held in July 2014.

There are ten parties which have seats in the DPR, passing a threshold of 3.5 percent of national vote at the 2014 legislative election. Two parties which also participated in the same election: the Star Crescent Party (PBB) and the Inodnesian Justice and Unity Party (PKPI) failed to meet the threshold and thus failed to gain seats at the DPR.  The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) became the winner of the 2014 legislative election securing 109 seats at the DPR while the People’s Conscience Party (Hanura) is the smallest party with 16 seats at the DPR. 

During the 2014 presidential election only two pairs of candidates vied for the presidency and vice presidency: Retired General and Gerindra Party chairman Prabowo Subianto who ran alongside former Economics Minister and PAN chairman Hatta Rajasa; and former Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo and his running mate returning Vice President Jusuf Kalla. 

Subianto-Rajasa was supported by a seven-party coalition which represented 353 seats in the parliament, while Widodo-Kalla was supported by a five-party coalition representing 207 legislative seats. 

Widodo-Kalla won the election by a vote of 53.15 percent (70,997,833) over Subianto-Rajasa with a vote of 46.85 percent (62,576,444)."
IL,Israel,58,67,52,"Israel provides direct public funding for parties, as well as free access to advertising, though in practice questions arose during the 2013 elections about how airtime was distributed. Multiple cases of non-financial resources being abused also occurred during those elections. By law, individuals are limited in the amount they can contribute to parties, and parties cannot spend more than a certain amount during campaigns. In practice, parties rely on public funding for their financing, while candidates are often reliant on individual donors. During the 2013 elections, a number of parties violated restrictions on contribution. Parties are required, in law, to report on their finances within and without the campaign period, while candidates must do so only during elections. Some reports filed by both parties and candidates fail to include a full list of donors and contributions. Some financial information is available online in pdf or word formats. Media organizations typically rely on the Comptroller's report, which covers the entire electoral process, in their coverage of political finance issues. Only some third party actors are required to report partial information on their independent political activities, and obtaining verified information on their spending and contributions is very difficult in practice. The Comptroller is responsible for overseeing political finance -- he is not chosen in a public process, and in practice, the Comptroller's independence is not guaranteed. The Comptroller did not carry out serious investigations in the wake of the 2013 campaign, and sanctions imposed for administrative violations have not deterred repeat violators. Because of a deficit of formidable sanctioning authority, the Comptroller is unable to ensure compliance with the law.","Israel has a unicameral legislature, the Knesset, of 120 members. It has a parliamentary system: The Knesset elects a symbolic head of state, the president, who after the parliamentary election consults with the heads of the elected parties to see whom amongst them can form a coalition. Then the chosen leader gets forty-two days to form a government and a coalition of 61 members or more. Afterwards the Knesset confirms him as the Prime Minister, and the government in general. Usually the prime minister will be the leader of the biggest party (in 2009 though it was the leader of the second biggest party). So far, Israel has always had a multi-party government.

The electoral system of Israel is closed-list (voters choose only parties, not individual candidates) proportional representation: the threshold was 2% in the last elections, and will be raised to 3.25% in the next elections. Lists are competing for the 120 seats of the Knesset for a 4 years term, in one multi-member district.. 

Campaign funds are managed by the Parties. Several parties hold before the general election an inside election (primaries) for candidates, in which they (the candidates) need to finance their own campaign. While only lists may campaign in general elections, individual candidates campaign directly in these intra-party elections. 

Traditionally (at least since 1977), the major political blocks in Israel have been: right-wing and religious parties; left-wing parties; Jewish ultra-religious ('Haredim') parties; and Arab parties. The Labor Party was in power since the establishment of the state (1948) until 1977. Since then, Halikud has been in power most of the time, but also the Labor Party (1984-1986, 1992-1996, 1999-2001) and the centrist party of Kadima (2005-2009). 

The most recent elections held at January 22, 2013. 32 lists competed, and 12 of them passed the threshold and won seats in the Knesset. The largest were: Halikud-Israel Beytenu (joint list of two right-wing parties, who split in July 2014) – 31 seats (26%); Yesh Atid (new centrist party) – 19 seats (16%); Labor Party – 15 seats (12.5%); Habait Hayehudi (right-wing religious party) – 12 seats (10%). Benjamin Netanyahu, the chairman of Halikud and Israel's prime minister since 2009 (and also in 1996-1999), formed the new government. The center-right coalition includes 5 parties – Halikud, Yesh Atid, Habait Hayehudi, Israel Beitenu and Hatnua (centrist party)."
IN,India,31,43,28,"There is no direct public funding for parties or candidates in India. Indirect public funding, however, in the form of free airtime on state run television, is granted to parties. Non-financial state resources were frequently abused during the 2014 elections. No laws restrict cash and anonymous donations, and individuals can legally donate as much as they like. Candidates are legally required to adhere to spending limits during campaigns, but in practice, few actually do. Parties are not subject to any restrictions on expenditure. Candidate limits were regularly breached in the 2014 campaign. In terms of reporting requirements, candidates must report only during campaigns, while parties should submit annual and post election reports. In practice, the reports submitted often lack important details on contributors and donations, and are not totally available to the public. As such, media coverage of official political finance data is scant at best, though violations are common. The independent political activities of third party actors are not regulated, and the public has no access to information on the financial workings of these actors. The Electoral Commission (ECI) is responsible for overseeing political finance. Its appointees are not fully merit-based, and their independence is less than guaranteed. Despite having sufficient staff and budget, the ECI does not audit any party reports, and its recommendations for sanctions are frequently ignored.","The Parliament of India comprises two Houses - the Lok Sabha (Lower House) and Rajya Sabha (Upper House). The Lok Sabha (House of the People) has a strength of 543 members who are directly elected by the citizens of India on the basis of universal adult franchise. Elections follow the first-past-the-post system and are held every five years. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) is a permanent body and can have a maximum of 250 members. 238 members are elected from States and Union Territories and 12 members nominated by the President of India from eminent persons from the field of literature, science, art and social service. One third of the members retire every second year and are replaced by newly elected members. Each member is elected for a term of six years. Elections to the Rajya Sabha are held through the system of proportional representation of elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the State by single transferable vote. In actuality, the Rajya Sabha has 245 members, 233 being elected by the members of the State Legisliative Assemblies.

The President of India is elected by the elected members of the Vidhan Sabhas (State Legislative Assembly), Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and serves for a period of 5 years (the incumbent can stand for re-election). A formula used to allocate votes ensures that there is a balance between the population of each state and the number of votes members from a State Legislative Assembly can cast and gives an equal balance between State Assembly members and National Parliament members. If no candidate receives a majority of votes, the losing candidates are eliminated from the contest and votes for them transferred to other candidates, until one candidate gains a majority. 

The powers to legislate on all matters concerning elections, including political finance regulations at the level of the national Parliament and State Legislatures, vests with the national Parliament. By law, political parties are free to receive voluntary contributions from any person and any company, other than a government company, under the condition that the parties must declare to the Election Commission the list  of contributions received in excess of Rs. 20,000 in any financial year by amount and identity of donor. Candidates are also free to receive contributions without limit but are subject to expenditure limits during elections and subject to declaring it in their income tax returns and providing receipts as supporting evidence that such donations were used for electoral expenses. Neither a political party nor a candidate can receive funding from any foreign sources except from Indian citizens based abroad.

The 2014 General Elections to the Lok Sabha was held between 7 April 2014 to 12 May 2014 in 9 phases across the country. The Schedule for the General Elections was announced on 5 March 2014 and the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) for the Guidance of Political Parties and Candidates came into operation on the same day in the entire country which was applicable to all Political Parties and to the Union and State Governments and UT Administrations. Results were declared on 16 May 2014.

Additionally, under Article 243K and 243ZA of the Constitution of India, elections are held once in five years to Panchayats (rural local bodies) and Municipalities (urban local bodies). These elections are conducted by the State Election Commission of every State. The State Election Commissioner is appointed by the Governor of the concerned State."
IT,Italy,39,52,28,"In Italy, parties receive direct public funding (though subsidies will be phased out entirely by 2017). They also receive free access to airtime for advertising purposes during campaigns, which, with few exceptions, is distributed equitably and transparently. Non-financial state resources are often used for electoral purposes. Individuals and corporations are limited in how much they can donate to parties, but not to individual candidates, and spending by both parties and candidates is capped during campaigns. Historically, parties are very reliant on public funding, though this will change as allocations of public funds diminish in the next few years. Both parties and candidates are required to report their financial information during campaigns, but only parties must submit reports outside of the campaign season. Submitted reports often contain, at best, a partially itemized list of all contributors, and lack some information. In public, it is difficult for the public to access high quality, machine readable, and standardized political finance information. Vote buying was common in Italy during the 2013 elections, as were other political finance violations. Some third party actors are required to report on their independent political activity, but trade unions and non profits are under no such obligations. This means that, in practice, the political actions of third party actors are mostly opaque. Recent reforms established a monitoring commission but the commission has no investigatory powers, and its appointees are neither completely merit based nor guaranteed full independence in practice. Its capacity to exercise control of political finance is limited, it carries out no investigations, and its administrative sanctions do not prevent frequent violations of the law.","Italy is a parliamentary republic with a bicameral legislature.  Members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected by voters on the basis of proportional representation in a party list system.  There are 360 deputies.  315 members of the Senate are directly elected on a regional basis, and a number of additional seats in the Senate are held open for appointed members.  To become a law, a bill must be approved by both houses.

The President of Italy is elected by a joint session parliament every 7 years.  Technically the head of state, he has the power the dissolve both houses of Parliament, and appoints the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister is either the leader of the coalition that wins elections, or an appointee of the President instructed to form a national unity government.  He must be supported by both houses of parliament.

The most recent elections to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate were held in February of 2013.  The left wing Democratic Party won 29.5% of the popular vote, followed by the center right coalition of the People of Freedom with 29.1% of the vote, and the Five Star Movement at 25.5%.  The DP holds 345 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 123 Senate seats; the PoF has 125 and 117, respectively, and the 5 Star Movement has 109 and 54.  The Democrats and the PoF are currently ruling in a grand coalition helmed by Matteo Renzi.

JP,Japan,50,58,52,"Japan has direct public funding for both parties and candidates. This support is distributed in accordance with the legally defined allocation mechanism, but in practice, information on those disbursements is not always available in a timely fashion. Free access to advertising is available for parties contesting seats in the lower house of parliament, and for candidates in the upper house. With the exception of resources available to sitting members of parliament (to which challenging candidates do not have access), non-financial state assets are not deployed during campaigns. Legislation places limits on the amounts individuals, corporations, and foreign sources can contribute for campaign purposes. Party expenditures are not limited, but candidate spending may not exceed a set limit. In practice, certain candidates appear to have attempted to circumvent limits on spending during the most recent elections. In terms of reporting requirements, parties are required to submit financial reports annually, while candidates do so only within campaigns. In practice, the reports submitted do not include many contributions. All submitted reports are published online, but only in pdf format, limiting the extent to which they are easily accessible. Third party actors, despite being present in Japan, are not regulated, either in law or in practice. Several oversight bodies are charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance. In practice, these authorities are afflicted by a lack of merit-based appointees, and concerns about their independence. Investigations are rare, and oversight agencies cannot unilaterally impose sanctions.","Japan has national elections for the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the House of Councillors (Upper House). The Lower House consists of a total of 480 members, 300 members who are elected in single-member constituency based election and 180 members who are elected in proportional representation election. The term of office in the Lower House is 4 years.  As for the Lower House election, constituency based election applies First-Past-The-Post system and proportional representation election. The Lower House proportional representation election introduces closed-list system. The Upper House consists of 242 members, 146 members who are elected in single-member or multi-member constituency based election and 96 members who are elected in proportional representation election. The term of office in the Upper House is 6 years, in which elections are held every 3 years for half of the members of the House. Therefore, 73 members are elected in constituency based election and 48 members are elected in proportional representation election in each Upper House election. As for the Upper House election, 31 members come from single-member constituencies and 42 members come from multi-member constituencies. In the multi-member constituencies, Single Non-Transferable Voting system is applied. Open-list system is used in the Upper House proportional representation election.

The campaign finance is mainly managed by each candidate. Each candidate collects donations, decides what to spend money for campaign, and submits a campaign finance report to Prefectural Election Administration Committee. The shortfall of the campaign finance is sometimes compensated by candidte's pocket money. Although parties are not allowed to spend money 'directly' in order to support specific candidates, parties can give money to specific candidates. So, parties' money goes to candidates first, then they spend. 

The most recent national election (except by-election) was the Upper House election on July 21, 2013. The most recent Lower House election during or before the research period was held on December 16, 2012. After the research period, the Lower House election was held on December 14, 2014."
KE,Kenya,42,67,18,"In Kenya, parties are entitled to receive direct public funding. In practice, they do so, though some parties have expressed concern that they did not receive the full amounts to which they were entitled in law. Some form of media access is, according to the law, supposed to be provided, but in practice, this has yet to happen. Non-financial state resources are regularly abused during campaigns. Many types of contributions are restricted or limited in law, but electoral spending is subject to no such limitations. Despite legal restrictions, parties and candidates both rely primarily on individual and corporate donors, and some documented abuses occurred during the 2013 elections. Reporting requirements mandate that both parties and candidates submit their financial information during campaigns, but only parties must do so on an annual basis. Submitted reports typically lack detailed information on contributors. Financial data is available to the public, though at a cost. Some third party actors are required to report on their independent activities during campaigns, according to the law, but they frequently fail to do so in practice. Responsibility for monitoring and enforcing political finance laws resides with two bodies: the Registrar of Political Parties and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The evidence suggests that appointments to these agencies are not fully merit-based, and appointees are not totally independent. In practice, very little enforcement occurs, and no sanctions were imposed during the 2013 elections.","Kenya has a directly elected executive president and a bicameral parliament comprising of the National Assembly and the Senate.

The membership of the Senate consists of: (a) 47 members each elected through a fast-past-the-post system (i.e. by the registered voters of the counties each county constituting a single constituency); (b) sixteen women members elected through proportional representation system (i.e. nominated by political parties in proportion to the number of senate seats they win); (c) two members, a man and a woman, representing the youth elected through proportional representation; (d) two members, a man and a woman, representing persons with disabilities elected through proportional representation; and (e) the Speaker who is an ex officio member.    

Parliamentary and senatorial campaigns are largely funded by the candidates themselves. Political parties also provide token support to their candidates using state funds and/or other monies acquired from legal sources. Some presidential candidates also provide support to parliamentary and senatorial candidates.    

The President of Kenya is elected through a fast-past-the-post system (i.e. by registered voters in a national election). Presidential campaigns are funded through parties using both state funds and/or monies raised from other legal sources. But the bulk of the campaign funds are raised by individual presidential candidates and their campaign teams. 

The last general elections were held on 4th March 2013. The previous ones took place on 27th December 2007. The Constitution provides that future elections shall be held on the second Tuesday in August in every fifth year. All the six positions are voted for on the same day.
 
It should be noted that the current political finance legislation only came out after last year’s elections took place, and thus it has not fully been tested yet. Additionally, the current legislation may undergo revisions in the coming months. This concerns possibly the public funding distribution criteria, which smaller parties are lobbying for, and possibly the development of regulations to the campaign finance act. One area that the regulations will have to specify is the division of tasks between the IEBC and the Registrar of Political Parties in monitoring and enforcing the Act. It will also have schedules and forms for parties to do their reporting, and it will potentially address some of the inconsistencies in the current law."

The law restricts a number of modalities of contributions, and also caps electoral spending by both parties and candidates. Parties rely on public funding for roughly 33% of their expenses. Several reports indicate that restrictions on contributions and expenditure were violated during the 2012 elections. Korean law includes extensive reporting requirements inside campaigns, and annual reporting is required outside election periods. In practice, however, many contributions, especially in-kind contributions, are not reported by parties and candidates. Access to political finance information is highly restricted. Most third party actors are prohibited from engaging in political activity, but supporters' associations are allowed to support campaigns, though they are required to report on their activities. In practice, their reports are less than comprehensive, and much of their campaigning remains opaque. The Election Commission is in charge of regulating political finance. In practice, its appointees are not always fully merit-based, nor is their independence completely guaranteed. It has the power to investigate, but chose not to do so after the 2012 elections. When it does impose sanctions, however, offenders always comply. Indeed, in Korea, enforcement of political finance is notably strong.","South Korea has a unicameral legislature with a directly elected presidential executive. The National Assembly is comprised of 300 seats. The majority of the seats, 246, are filled in first-part-the-post elections in single-member constituencies. The remaining 54 are chosen by the parties via proportional representation. There are three main sources of public funds: public subsidies, party membership fees, and funds collected from the public by supporters' associations. The party and supporters' associations distribute funds to candidates. 

The president is popularly elected by a plurality of the vote every 5 years. Presidential candidates are entitled to public subsidies in accordance with their party's presence in the National Assembly. They are also entitled to reimbursement from the taxpayer for election expenses. Each candidate can also have a supporters' association that collects money on its behalf within the bounds of the law.

State resources are often abused during campaigns. Some restrictions on contributions to candidate exist, as do candidate expenditures, but parties are wholly unregulated in law. Elections are funded largely by foreign actors, or by candidates themselves. Only candidates are required to report on their finances during campaigns, and no reports are necessary outside the campaign season. In practice, the reports that are submitted tend to lack detailed information on contributors. No financial information is available to the public. Third party actors are not regulated by Lebanese law. The Supervisory Commission on the Electoral Campaign (SCEC) is charged with overseeing political finance, but its leaders are not appointed in merit-based, public competitions, and their independence, in practice, is not guaranteed.

The SCEC is too weak to meaningfully enforce political finance law.","Lebanon has a majoritarian electoral system with a unicameral legislature and an indirectly elected head of state.  The President is elected to six year terms by members of Parliament; presidential candidates need the votes of 2/3 of Parliament in order to be elected.  The President appoints the Prime Minister, who serves as the head of state.    The President is required to be a Maronite, and the Prime Minister must be a Sunni Muslim (the Speaker of Parliament is reserved for Shi'a).

The 128 members of the Assembly of Representatives are directly elected every four years according to the principles of confessional distribution.  Each religious community is allotted a certain number of seats in the Assembly, but all candidates in each district must receive a plurality in order to be elected.  Seats are split across 26 electoral districts.  Campaign funds are predominantly managed by candidates, but parties may contribute to the candidate's electoral bank account. 

Nowadays, the Lebanese political system is malfunctioning due to the division between the two main rival political camps, the March 8 and March 14 coalitions. This division led to the occurrence of numerous political, security and technical events resulting in the postponement of both the parliamentary and presidential elections due respectively in June 2013 and May 2014. Between 2005 and 2014, three different types of elections were held; the parliamentary elections in 2005 and 2009, the presidential election in 2008, and the municipal election in 2010. The 2009 parliamentary elections resulted in the March 14 coalition securing 71 seats and the March 8 coalition winning the remaining 57 seats."

Access to advertising in public media is provided, both in law and in practice, for both parties and presidential candidates. Other, non-financial state resources were regularly abused during the 2010 elections. No restrictions on contribution or expenditure are codified in law, meaning that parties and candidates can receive and spend unlimited amounts during campaigns. Reporting requirements are also sparse. The only legal requirement is that parties submit annual reports to the Commissioner of Elections. In practice, filed reports are not detailed, and very little political finance information is available to the public. Third party actors are not regulated by Sri Lankan law.

The President who is the head of state, head of government and commander in chief of the armed forces, is directly elected for a six-year term.   Presidents may only be removed from office through a process of impeachment with the concurrence of the Supreme Court. The President appoints and heads a cabinet of ministers responsible to Parliament. The President's deputy is the prime minister, who leads the ruling party in Parliament.
  
The lack of provisions in the law regarding campaign finance and the flagrant misuse of state resources which grossly disproportionately advantage incumbents has raised the issue of political finance, but with little result.  This is largely attributable to a poitical culture of patronage and relative disregard for transparency in public affairs. The situation is compounded when the political culture and the structure of power in practice gives way to a dynastic project of populist authoritarianism, as at present.

Campaign contributions are made to both parties and to candidates and are managed accordingly. Given the leader-centric culture, practice this amounts to the leader of the party deciding on the distribution and disbursement of resources.

Parties and candidates are both entitled to receive state funding for campaigns; in practice, they do so. Indirect funding, in the form of advertising slots on radio and television, is also provided. In fact, parties and candidates cannot otherwise buy advertising - they must rely exclusively on the slots allocated to them through the indirect public funding mechanism. In practice, some parties found ways to circumvent the law during the 2012 elections, and obtained more advertising time than was their due. There are also a few instances in which non-financial state resources appear to have been illegally deployed in the 2012 campaign. Independent candidates, though not parties, are prohibited from receiving cash donations; anonymous donations and corporate contributions are totally impermissible. Contributions from individuals are capped, and campaign spending is limited for both parties and candidates. Because of these restrictions, parties rely primarily on public funding for their financing, though individual donors and supporters' donations provide supplementary assistance. During the 2012 elections, several candidates and parties spent more than was legally permissible during the campaign. Legal reporting requirements are stringent, and both parties and candidates are supposed to submit itemized financial reports on a regular basis, both within and outside campaigns. These requirements are the result of a new law passed after the 2012 elections, which means that, during those elections, parties and candidates, in practice, reported less frequently. Their reports generally included a full list of donors, a rare case within the MPT sample. Financial reports submitted to the oversight authority, the INE, are available online, but not all information is available immediately, and data is often uploaded in pdf format. Third party actors in Mexico are prohibited from any sort of campaign activity. In practice, however, such actors engaged in campaigning during the 2012 elections, and they did not report any financial information to the authorities. The recently reformed National Electoral Institute (INE) is charged with oversight of political finance. Many of its appointees, in practice, are selected in merit-based processes, and their independence, for the most part, is protected. The INE is active and well staffed; it carries out investigations and audits regularly its predecessor performed more than 1,000 during the 2012 campaign). Its audits are public, and it often imposes sanctions. However, parties and candidates failed to comply with sanctions regarding 2012, instead going through a lengthy appeals process by which to escape censure. Enforcement is likely to improve due to the recently enacted reforms, though carrying out the full scope of its activities may prove a challenge for the INE.","The United States of Mexico consist of 31 states and a federal district. The federal republic has a directly elected presidential executive and a bicameral legislature consisting of the Lower House and the Senate.

The President is directly elected for a six-year-term through plurality voting in one national district, and cannot be reelected. 

The Lower House is composed of 500 legislators. These representatives are renewed every three years through a mixed system: 300 representatives are elected through a system of plurality voting in single-member districts and the remaining 200 representatives through a system of proportional representation in five multimember districts of 40 seats each. Parties must present closed candidate lists in these multimember districts. Consecutive reelection of legislators used to be prohibited. A 2014 constitutional reform (decree 216) established that from the 2015 elections onwards, legislators may be reelected up to three terms. 

The Senate consists of 128 members that are renewed every six years through a mixed system. The 31 states and the federal district each elect three senators: two are elected through plurality voting and the third is assigned to the party that obtained the second highest amount of votes. The remaining 32 senators are elected through a system of proportional representation in one national district. Consecutive reelection of senators used to be prohibited. A 2013 constitutional reform (decree 216) established that from the 2018 elections onwards, senators may be reelected for one additional term.

Political parties manage and fund the presidential, legislative, and senatorial campaigns. Towards this end, they mainly depend on public resources - such as public funding and free media access - that are distributed to the parties by the National Electoral Institute´s general Council based on formulas established in Article 41 of the Constitution. Campaign funding can also include private funding in the form of supporter´s donations and member contributions; however, the Constitution establishes donation limits for both candidates' individual contributions and for member/supporter contributions and donations. In addition, the law establishes that corporations, unions and any other legal entities are banned from providing resources to political campaigns. The private acquisition of media access is prohibited completely. As a result, election campaigns are funded almost completely by the state.

Based on the Constitution, Malaysia has a bicameral legislature that consists of a House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat) and a Senate (Dewan Negara). Members of the Dewan Rakyat (also commonly known as Members of Parliament, MPs) are elected directly through general elections, which are held not more than every five years. The MPs are elected in single member constituencies on the basis of first-past-the-post voting. The last General Elections were conducted in 2013. There are currently 222 seats in the  Dewan Rakyat, but the Election Commission is due to conduct redelineation of countries and increases the number of seats in the Parliament. The last redelineation exercise was last conducted in 2003. Article 113 2 (ii) of the Federal Constitution stipulates that the exercise must be conducted once every eight years.

Individual contributions to parties are capped, but unlimited donations may be made to candidates. Corporations may not give at all to parties, and are limited in how much they can legally contribute to candidates. Foreign financing is banned for parties, but not for candidates. Spending limits are in place, but apply only to candidates, not parties. These patchwork restrictions and the absence of public funding combine to create a system in which parties and candidates rely heavily on private donors, some of whom violate contribution caps.

The National Electoral Commission (NEC) oversees political finance. Its members are not appointed in public processes, but are otherwise qualified, and in practice, their independence is protected. The NEC has sufficient budget and staff, but carries out relatively few in depth audits during campaigns. When it imposes sanctions, usually for failures to submit the necessary financial reports, offenders comply. Gaps exist in the political finance legal framework, especially where reporting requirements are concerned, but generally, enforcement in Poland is strong.","Poland is a semi-presidential multi-party system. The Head of State (i.e. President) is directly elected every five years and can only be re-elected once. If no candidate obtains the absolute majority of votes in the first round, the two most popular candidates face each other in a round-off. Among his/her most important powers it is possible to mention the right to initiate, veto or question (before the Constitutional Court) legislation. Bronisław Komorowski - elected in July 2010 - is the current President of Poland.

The bicameral Parliament, which is renewed every four years, is composed by two Chambers: the Sejm (lower) and the Senate (upper). The former has 460 seats elected through party-list proportional representation using the D´hondt formula in 41 multi-seat constituencies. The electoral threshold, which is not applied to Electoral Committees formed by national minorities (e.g. Germans), is 5 per cent for Electoral Committees (ECs) composed of single parties and 8 per cent for ECs composed of coalitions. The latter is composed by 100 members who are elected (at least since 2011) according to the first-past-the-post electoral system. Legislative revision, which in any case can be overturned by the absolute majority of the Sejm, constitutes its main function.

 Although appointed by the President, the Prime Minister and his/her cabinet (i.e. Council of Ministers) needs to have the vote of confidence of the majority Sejm. If it is not possible to form a government after three attempts, the President is obliged to dissolved the parliament and call for new (anticipated) elections. After the last legislative elections (9 October 2011), Donald Tusk (leader of Civic Platform-PO) renewed its coalition government with the agrarian Polish Peasant Party (PSL). The opposition is formed by the rightist Law and Justice (PiS), the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the liberal Your Movement (TR, but known at the time of the elections as Palikot´s Movement). Apart from the German minority, there are two other (minor) parliamentary groups: United Poland (SP) and Poland Together (PR) - formed after splitting from PiS and PO, respectively. Ewa Kopacz, which replaced Donald Tusk on September 22nd 2014, is the current Prime Minister of Poland.

 ECs with at least one seat in either the Sejm or the Senate have the right to ask for a (total or partial) reimbursement of their electoral expenses at the time of the electoral campaign. Political parties which have obtained at least 3 percent of the votes (6 per cent in the case of coalitions) are entitled to an annual subsidy from the State budget. The reimbursement is calculated according to the number of seats obtained. The subsidy is calculated according to the percentage of votes obtained."
PY,Paraguay,33,45,28,"In Paraguay, direct public funding is provided for parties. The distribution and allocation of that funding, however, is not entirely transparent. Non-financial state resources were regularly abused during the 2013 campaign, but indirect public funding in the form of free advertising slots was equitably distributed to parties and eligible candidates. Limits cap the amount that individual donors, corporations, foreign sources, and third parties can give to parties, while there are no restrictions on contributions to candidates. Campaign spending is capped only for parties, though in practice, parties employed a variety of strategies to circumvent those caps during the 2013 elections. In terms of reporting requirements, parties are required to submit detailed reports during and outside of campaign periods. In practice, reports often lack the requisite detail, and very little political finance information is made available to the public. Third party actors engaging in partisan campaign activities, especially nonprofits, are present in Paraguay, but their independent expenditures and contributions are not regulated. The Electoral Justice (TSJE) oversees political finance. In practice, appointments to the TSJE are not definitively merit-based, and appointees are not independent of other branches of government. The TSJE did not perform any audits or investigations after the 2013 campaign, nor did it sanction potential violators. Because the TSJE is politically compromised, enforcement is fairly weak.","Paraguay's electoral system is characterized by a directly elected president, who serves as the head of state, and a bicameral legislature.  In presidential campaigns, the candidate receiving the most votes is declared the winner.  Presidents serve for one non-renewable five year term.  Campaign funds are collected and managed at the party level.  Horacio Cartes of the center-right Colorado Party is the current president, having been elected in 2013.

The legislature, or Congress, is made up of the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Senators.  The Chamber of Deputies has 80 members, each of which is elected via proportional representation on closed party lists at the provincial level.  The 45 Senators are also elected proportionally via closed party lists, and they run on a nationwide basis.  Members of both houses are elected for five year terms.  Electoral campaigns in both houses are funded and managed at the party level.

The Colorado Party currently controls both houses, while the Radical Liberal Party is the dominant opposition force. Legislative and presidential elections are held concurrently every five years."
RO,Romania,55,78,43,"In Romania, parties, in law and in practice, receive direct public funding. Indirect funding, in the form of free access to advertising on public media, is granted to both parties and candidates. Other, non-financial state resources, however, are frequently abused for campaign purposes in Romania. Contributions to both candidates and parties are highly regulated, and electoral spending is capped for both actors as well. Despite the extensive legal framework in this regard, parties elude the legally specified limits on contribution and expenditure in various ways. Reporting requirements in Romania mandate that all parties and candidates file financial reports during campaigns; only parties must report outside of campaigns. Despite legal requirements, in practice, the names of contributors are regularly excluded from reports. All submitted financial information, however, is made available online in pdf formats. Third party actors, especially NGOs that are closely tied to particular parties, are involved in election campaigns, but their independent political activities are not subject to any regulation. The Electoral Permanent Authority (AEP) oversees political finance. Its appointees are highly politicized, but there are some in practice guarantees in place to protect their independence. The AEP is active in its oversight role, as it carries out investigations and imposes sanctions, despite having some budgeting and staffing constraints. Offenders usually comply with the sanctions imposed, but repeat offenders occasionally appear.","Romania has a semi-presidential, bicameral parliamentary system. In 2008, the closed-list proportional system for both chambers of the Parliament  in 42 constituencies was changed. Members of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are currently elected by direct popular vote in single-member electoral districts on the basis of mixed member proportional representation (Law no. 35/2008). The 42 counties of Romania (41 administrative counties and one for Bucharest metropolitan area) represent the electoral constituencies and are further divided into single-member districts with the ratio of 70.000 inhabitants for every Deputy and 160.000 inhabitants for every Senator.  In 2008, a 43rd constituency was added for the representation of Romanians living abroad. 

There are currently 176 Senators and 412 Deputies, but the total numbers of each fluctuate at each new election. According to the Constitution of Romania (art. 62, par. 2) and the law 35/2008 (art. 9 par.1) the organizations of citizens belonging to national minorities, which fail to obtain the number of votes for representation in Parliament, have the right to 1 seat each in the Chamber of Deputies. Citizens of a national minority are entitled to be represented by one organization only. The representation of minorities has been granted since 1990.

 The head of state is the President, who is elected for a five year term in a two round system (after a change from four-year terms after the 2004 election). If the leading candidate does not receive 50% of the vote +1 during the first round of an election, there is a run-off between the top two vote-getters (Constitution of Romania, art.81, par. 2, 3, law no 370/2004 for the election of the President, art. 1, par. 2, 3, 4). Art 81.4 of the Constitution (art. 81, par. 4) limits an elected president to two terms in office. In all types of elections, campaign funds are typically controlled by the parties.

The most recent legislative elections in Romania took place in 2012.  The Social Liberal Union (USL) won both houses of Parliament, followed by the Right Romania Alliance (ARD) and the People's Party (PP-DD).    Presidential elections occurred in November 2014, but these elections fall outside of the period of study for this report."
RS,Serbia,64,86,57,"Political finance is highly regulated in Serbia. Direct public funding is available for parties, and in practice, it is allocated equitably and in a transparent fashion. Indirect funding, in the form of access to advertising in public media, is also awarded, but opposition parties are typically consigned to unfavorable timeslots in contravention of the law. The use of other state resources, including staff, vehicles, and buildings, is prohibited. In practice, however, such resources are regularly abused during campaigns. Contributions are highly regulated, but no limits check the amount of spending that can legally occur. In practice, despite the limits on donations that are in place, the evidence indicates that violations occur. Where reporting is concerned, parties are required to submit regular financial reports both during campaigns and on an annual basis. In practice, filed reports are quite detailed, though in-kind contributions are sometimes not represented properly. Filed information is available online, but not in machine readable formats. Third party actors are not regulated. The Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) is responsible for oversight of political finance. The ACA is independent, and its appointees are selected in merit-based, public competitions. Its staff and budget, however, are too small for it to conduct complete oversight. The ACA carried out some investigations of political finance issues after the last elections, but complete information on those investigations is unavailable. When it imposes sanctions, parties usually comply, but repeat offenders exist.","Serbia has a unicameral legislature with a directly elected head of state. The National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia is a unicameral body consisting of 250 representatives. The election system is proportional with Serbia as one electoral unit. 

The President of the Republic of Serbia is elected directly by a majority of votes. If none of the candidates receives a majority of the votes, the elections are repeated within 15 days and the candidates are the two candidates who received the most votes in the first round. The President has quite restricted competencies.

The mandate of the President is 5 years, and the mandate of the National Assembly is 4 years.

The key executive power lies in the hands of the Government i.e. Prime Minister.

The Serbian system recognizes political parties, coalitions and citizens' groups as eligible actors in elections, therefore financing of campaigns is provided only through political parties, coalitions and citizens' groups.

The most recent parliamentary elections took place in 16 March 2014."
RU,Russian Federation,51,71,45,"Russia has a strong political finance regime, and is a good example of a country in which political finance regulations, rather than encouraging a level playing field, actually restrict electoral competition. Direct public funding is awarded to parties in the form of post election reimbursements, in law and in practice, on the basis of electoral performance. Free access to advertising is provided to parties and candidates, but during the 2011 and 2012 elections, slots were distributed so as to privilege the ruling party's campaign. Further, non-financial state resources were frequently deployed by the ruling party for electoral purposes. Contributions are highly restricted, and a cap is in place for electoral spending by both parties and candidates. In practice, however, many violations of these restrictions occurred during recent elections. In law, parties and candidates both are required to report their financial information during campaign periods, but outside the campaign, only parties must file reports. In practice, submitted reports often fail to include all contributions, especially in-kind contributions, and are not fully itemized. Some of the submitted information is published online, and of that, some is in a machine readable format. Third party actors, despite being active in Russian campaigns, are not regulated. The Central Elections Commission (CEC) is in charge of enforcing political finance law. The CEC is highly politicized, and typically focuses its regulatory power on opposition parties. It is largely opaque in its operations. The CEC cannot impose sanctions on parties or candidates found to have violated the law, so it passes along recommendations to other government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance and the General Prosecutor, when pursuing punishments. Violators typically comply with the imposed sanctions. That said, due to the CEC's bias, rules are selectively enforced so as to favor the ruling party, and restrictions on contributions inhibit opposition parties ability to meaningfully contest elections.","The Russian Federation is a federal semi-presidential republic with a bicameral parliament, known as the Federal Assembly. The Federation Council, the upper house, comprises  167 representatives, with two representatives from each of the Federation's constituent members (formally, the number should be 170 to reflect representation from 85 federal subjects). The two delegates for each federal constituent unit are subject to different election procedures. Representatives for the legislative component are members of the federal subject's legislature and are nominated by the chairman of their regional assembly. The legislative representatives are elected by a vote in their regional assembly. Federal Council delegates representing the executive function are appointed by governors of their federal region.

The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is composed of 450 members who are elected on a party list proportional representation system.  Seats in the Duma are divided among parties whose federal list of candidates obtains 7% of the national vote, provided that there at least two such lists and that these lists together receive more than 60% of the total vote (the threshold to entry will change to 6% from 2016).  Additionally, lists that receive less than 7% but more than 6% of the national vote receive two seats, whereas parties with between 5% and 6% of the national vote will be rewarded with one seat in the Duma. The Prime Minister is the head of government, and he is selected from the leading party in the Duma.  Parties manage the campaign finances of Duma candidates.

The President, the head of state, is elected by the people for a six year term.  No more than two consecutive terms may be served.  Presidential candidates typically fund and manage their own campaigns.

The most recent elections to the Duma were held in December of 2011. Four political parties secured seats in the Duma: United Russia secured 238 (49.3%) of the 450 seats, the Communist Party (KPRF) won 92 seats (19.19%), Just Russia took 64 (13.2%) seats, while LDPR won 56 (11.7%). The election was marred by allegations of electoral fraud.

The most recent presidential elections occurred in May of 2012. Five registered presidential candidates competed at the polls. Vladimir Putin, then Prime Minister representing the ruling United Russia, won the election with 63.6 of the vote. Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF) won 17.2%. Mikhail Prokhorov, an independent candidate secured 8% of the vote. Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR) and Sergey Mironov (Just Russia) won 6.2% and 3.9% respectively."
RW,Rwanda,30,28,41,"In Rwanda, there is direct public funding, both in law and in practice, for parties and candidates. Funds are disbursed after campaigns. No indirect funding is provided. Non-financial state resources are often abused. With the exception of a ban on contributions from foreign sources to political parties, contributions and expenditure are not restricted in the least. In the absence of contribution limits, parties are funded by their members and the business ventures they control. Reporting requirements in Rwanda are very light: the only requirement articulated in law is that parties must submit financial reports on an annual basis. Only contributions over more than one million Rwandan francs have be included in the reports. Further, no reporting during campaigns is necessary, and candidates do not have to report at all. This means that, in practice, very little meaningful political finance data is reported, and even less is easily available to the public, which can only access submitted reports by request. Interestingly, there were no documented cases of political finance violations during the 2010 and 2013 elections. This is explained by the fact that, in a largely unregulated political finance regime, breaking the law is nigh on impossible. Third party actors are not regulated in Rwanda. The Office of the Ombudsman is responsible for oversight of political finance issues. Appointees, in practice, are not chosen in public, merit-based processes, and the independence of Ombudsmen is not guaranteed. Nevertheless, the office carried out at least 16 investigations into political finance during the 2010 and 2013 elections, though it released no information on the results of those audits. It has limited power to impose sanctions, but its edicts are complied with when they are issued. In general, Rwanda's political finance regulatory framework is very weak. Few laws address the issue, and despite the power of the Ombudsman, little practical enforcement occurs.","Rwanda is a parliamentary republic with a directly elected president.  Presidents can serve two seven year terms, and campaign funds are funded at the party level.  The legislature is bicameral.

Of the 80 deputies, 53 are directly elected at the district level on a closed party list system of proportional representation.  24 members must be female, and they're elected by provincial councils; 2 members are appointed by the National Youth Council, and 1 seat is reserved for a member chosen by the Federation of the Associations of the Disabled.  Campaigns for deputies are operated and funded at the party level.

SB,Solomon Islands,15,19,11,"The Solomon Islands do not have systems of direct or indirect public funding. Non-financial state resources often featured in the 2010 campaign. The legal framework does not include many restrictions on contributions. Candidate spending is limited, but parties are able to spend as much as they like during campaigns. Both parties and candidates, in law, must file financial reports after the campaign season, and parties must also submit annual reports. In practice, few parties or candidates actually file the required information. The data that is submitted is concerned solely with expenditures. No contribution data is available. Further, the public cannot, in practice, any political finance information. The independent political activities of third party actors are totally unregulated.

The PPC's members are not appointed on merit, nor are they fully guaranteed independence.

SE,Sweden,37,39,50,"The Swedish political finance system provides direct public funding for both parties and candidates. This funding takes the form of reimbursements after campaigns, and is applied equitably in practice. Parties and candidates do not, however, receive any indirect assistance. Intriguingly, Sweden does not explicitly ban the use of non-financial state resources during campaigns, and yet, no such resources are used. This fact makes Sweden one of a few outliers in the MPT sample. Restrictions on contribution and expenditure are mostly nonexistent. For funding, parties rely primarily on public disbursements, though private donations and party held businesses also provide some financing. A new 2014 law now requires parties and candidates have to report on their contributions received on an annual basis. No other requirements exist, and the law has not yet been in place long enough to assess whether, in practice, reports are actually filed. Before the passage of this new law, parties came to an informal agreement by which they self-published their contributions received each year. This meant that, in practice, the public had access to some political finance information, but no data on expenditures was available. The independent political activities of third party actors are not regulated under Swedish law. The 2014 reform designated a new authority, the Legal, Financial, and Administrative Services Agency (LFAS), to oversee political finance. In law, the LFAS does not have investigative powers, though it can enforce sanctions for failures to comply with the law. At the time of this research, the LFAS had yet to oversee an election campaign, making it difficult to assess its enforcement of sanctioning authority.","Sweden has a unicameral legislature.  Elections to the Riksdag are held every four years, and seats are allocated on the basis of proportional representation.  To enter parliament, a party must obtain at least 4% of the national vote, or 12% of the vote in a single constituency.  Seats in the Riksdag are divided into permanent and non-permanent seats due to the proportional representation rule.  The adjusted odd number method is used to allocate a total of 310 permanent seats.  In the current electoral cycle, an additional 39 non-permanent seats were allocated to parties.

Voting usually occurs on a party list basis, but preference voting for a specific candidate instead of a party is permitted.

The prime minister is the head of government, and is appointed by members of the Riksdag.  The Swedish monarch is the head of state.

Campaigns are paid for by parties (parties are publicly funded), and largely managed at the party level.

The most recent elections occurred in September 2010, though new elections will be held in September of 2014. In the 2010 elections, eight parties won seats in parliament, in descending order by number of seats the Social Democrats, the Moderate party, the Green party, the Liberal party, the Centre party, the Sweden Democrats and (same number of seats) the Left party and the Christian Democrats.

SI,Slovenia,62,80,66,"In Slovenia, both parties and candidates are entitled to receive reimbursements after the conclusion of campaigns. In practice, they do so. Indirect public funding in the form of free access to public media is also provided, though in the 2011 and 2014 parliamentary elections, some parties received more advertising slots than they should have according to the allocation mechanism prescribed in law. Non-financial state resources are often abused in Slovenian campaigns. Contributions are highly regulated, and there is also a cap on spending during campaigns. The spending cap is applicable to both candidates and parties. Few, if any, violations of these limits have occurred during recent campaigns, making Slovenia a relatively rare case among the countries researched for this project. During campaigns, both parties and candidates are required to submit financial reports; outside of the campaign season, only parties have to file annual reports on their financial dealings. Filed reports are somewhat detailed, though many lack a full list of contributors. Some third party actors, notably party academies, conduct campaign activities, but they are not subject to any regulation. The Court of Auditors, a highly respected institution, oversees political finance. In practice, its members are appointed in public, merit-based processes, though their independence is not fully guaranteed. The Court of Auditors has a relatively large staff and budget, and it conducted numerous audits during the 2011 and 2012 elections. The results of its investigations are transparent. Regarding sanctions, the Court of Auditors has not imposed many in recent years, but some penalties have been complied with.","Slovenia is a parliamentary republic with a bicameral legislature.  Formally, the head of state is the president.  Presidents are directly elected in a majoritarian run off  system to 5 year terms, of which they may serve no more than two consecutively.  In presidential elections, campaign funds are managed both on the party level and at the individual level, depending on the characteristics of the candidate.  If the candidate is formally independent, he manages his campaign, but if he runs under a party banner, the party will be largely responsible for his campaign activities and finances.

The National Assembly (Državni Zbor) is the lower house of Parliament.  It has 90 members.  88 of those members are elected to 4 year terms in a closed list PR system with a 4% threshold for party representation.  2 seats are reserved for the Hungarian and Italian minorities in Slovenia, and they are directly elected by members of those minorities using the Borda system (in which voters rank the list of candidates in order of preference, and candidates receive points equal to their rankings and the number of candidates competing).  Campaigns are managed at the party level.  According to the Constitution, deputies of the National Assembly are representatives of all the people and shall not be bound by any instructions. The rights and duties of citizens and other persons may be determined by the National Assembly only by law.  Laws may be proposed by the Government or by any deputy. Laws may also be proposed by at least five thousand voters. The National Assembly may order inquiries on matters of public importance, and it must do so when required by a third of the deputies of the National Assembly or when required by the National Council. For this purpose it shall appoint a commission which in matters of investigation and examination has powers comparable to those of judicial authorities.

The National Council (Državni Svet) is the upper chamber of Parliament.  It has 40 members who are indirectly elected by civil society organisations and local bodies and composed by representatives of functional and local interests.  The Council has little power, and no formal election campaigns occur.

The most recent Presidential elections were held in November and December of 2012, and the most recent parliamentary elections occurred in July 2014.  Most of this assessment is based on data from the previous parliamentary elections in 2011.

The Seventh National Assembly elections took place on 4 December 2011. These were the first early elections in the history of independent Slovenia. With the 28,51% of the votes, the winner of the elections was Pozitivna Slovenija (Positive Slovenia) and its leader, Zoran Jankovič. The party received 28 seats in the National Assembly (NA). Second place, with 26 seats was occupied by Slovenska demokratska stranka (Slovenian Democratic Party) and in third with 10 seats was Socialni demokrati (Social democrats). This was the first time in the history that the winning party did not form Government since Pozitivna Slovenija could not find coalition partners. The Government was then formed by the second political party Slovenska demokratska stranka.

The President of the Republic of Slovenia is formally the highest political official in Slovenia, while the PM in reality posses the biggest power.  The President is charged with ""representing the Republic of Slovenia at home and abroad, and is the supreme commander of its armed forces"" (Article 102 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia). The President of the Republic calls elections to the National Assembly; promulgates laws; appoints state officials where provided by law; appoints and recalls ambassadors and envoys of the Republic, and accepts the letters of credence of foreign diplomatic representatives; issues instruments of ratification; decides on the granting of clemency; confers decorations and honorary titles; performs other duties determined by this Constitution. 

Where required by the National Assembly the President of the Republic also calls for elections. In addition, the President also proposes and/or appoints the leadership of the independent supervisory institutions, like the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption, the Information Commissioner, the Court of Audit, Ombudsman, etc."

In practice, that funding was distributed in early 2014, but then returned to the authorities after the Constitution's suspension. Parties also, in law, receive free air time for advertising. However, the turmoil in Thailand affected the distribution of advertising slots, resulting in a less than equitable situation. The legal framework sets forth several restrictions on contributions, and also limits the amount that can be spent during elections. Some financial information must be reported: parties and candidates must submit post election financial reports, and parties must file additional reports annually. In practice, the submitted reports contain some information on contributors. Some of that data is then published online in pdf formats, but not all of it is accessible to the public. The independent political activities of third parties actors are not regulated in Thailand. The Election Commission of Thailand (ECT) is charged with oversight of political finance. In practice, appointees to the ECT are not chosen on merit, nor is their independence protected. Nevertheless, the body does have a substantial staff and budget, and conducted several investigations into potential violations in the wake of the 2014 elections.

An electoral system that is employed for Senate’s election (77 seats out of 150) is a plurality system (first past the post). The remaining of 73 seats is appointed. A mixed-electoral system or to be specific ‘Mixed-Member-Majoritarian’ is an electoral system for a House of Representatives. A House of Representatives consists of 500 MPs, which 375 MPs are elected in a single-member district throughout the country using a plurality system (FPTP) and the remaining 125 MPs are elected in a nation-wide party list using proportional representation system with no minimum threshold. For the party list, it is an open list that each party has to submit to the Election Commission before the last day of candidacy submission. However, a party may not need to submit a list of 125 candidates for a party list submission (meaning that it can sumit less than 125 candidates for party list). A calculation method for allocating seats in party list is a highest averages methods or the D’Hondt method. 

A February 2, 2014 general election is the most recent election in Thailand as a result of an announcement of dissolution of parliament by the PM Yingluck Shinawatra on December 9, 2013. A string of political crises has led to this early election. Before an election day, there were several concerns about whether a general election should be postponed due to political crises and difficulties in electoral administration. During a period of candidacy registration, an opposition who called for a boycott of this election had disrupted a registration process – by preventing candidate to enter a registration venue, which this event turned violence or by blocking a transportation convoy of ballots, in many parts of Thailand. It is noteworthy that ‘Democrat Party’ an oldest and major political party in Thailand also boycotted this election. An election, however, has proceeded as scheduled – though some of the poll stations were blocked by protesters.

Because of violence and disruption between pro and anti-government protestors during a period of election and on an Election Day (and political atmosphere in general), a state ombudsman filed a petition to the constitutional court to rule on this matter. On March 21, 2014 Thailand’s Constitutional court ruled that February 2 election is invalid. As a result, political crisis was still continuing and deepening. Until, May 20, 2014 the Army declared martial law followed by a coup d’état on May 22, 2014."
TR,Turkey,39,50,37,"There is direct public funding for parties in Turkey, both in law and in practice. Turkish law also provides indirect assistance, in the form of access to media during campaigns. Non-financial state resources are widely abused during campaigns. Restrictions on contribution apply only to parties and to presidential candidates; no limits constrain the size of donations to parliamentary candidates. Despite these loopholes, violations of the law are, in practice, relatively frequent. Campaign spending is not limited for any actor. In terms of reporting requirements, parties are supposed to submit annual financial reports, and presidential candidates are required to file reports after the conclusion of campaigns. Parliamentary candidates are not obligated to report any financial information. In practice, many of the reports that are filed do not include in-kind contributions or their contributors. Direct political finance data is not accessible to the public. Third party actors and their campaign activities are under no regulation in Turkey. Responsibility for monitoring political finance is split between two bodies: the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Board of Elections. The former is responsible for parties' compliance with the law, while the latter oversees presidential candidates. Concerns about the merit of the members of these bodies exist, and their independence is not fully guaranteed. In practice, neither authority conducts investigations. Nevertheless, sanctions imposed on violators are often, but not always, complied with. Enforcement in Turkey is weakened by the bifurcation of responsibilities between two separate authorities, and by loopholes that reduce the effectiveness of the current legal framework.","The Grand National Assembly of Turkey (TGNA) is a unicameral parliament which is composed of 550 deputies who are elected by popular vote every four years. Voters vote for a party list of deputies without being able to choose specific individual candidates from the lists; i.e., they can only vote in block for a single party list as determined by the central party organs. Therefore, the electoral system can be characterized as a closed-list proportional representation system. The allocation of seats is calculated according to the D’Hondt method. A 10 percent nationwide threshold is practiced in elections. Those political parties failing to receive at least 10% of the valid votes throughout the country in general elections cannot be represented in the parliament. However, this threshold does not apply to independent candidates. 

Electoral campaigns are basically funded by political parties yet candidates also make a budget for their individual expenses relative to their own wealth and personal networks.

The President of the Republic is the Head of the State, elected for five years and no more than two terms. The Head of the State was elected by a popular vote for the first time on August 10, 2014. According to the Law No. 6271 on Presidential Elections presidential candidates shall have only donations and aids from natural persons who are Turkish citizens. However, the Supreme Board of Elections issued a circular enabling the political parties to organize campaigns for the candidates, which is not regulated by the law. Thus, campaigns were funded by the donations to the candidates and by political parties. Although the candidates were not eligible to receive state funding, except for free air time, the presidential campaigns were also funded indirectly by the state aid through the three political parties which received annual state aid.

The Council of Ministers (Cabinet) consists of the Prime Minister designated by the President of the Republic from among members of the TGNA, and ministers nominated by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President. Members of the Council of Ministers (Cabinet) are responsible for the execution of general policies. The Prime Minister has legal and political responsibility for the activities of the Council of Ministers as a whole. Although the President is given extensive powers, the current constitutional system is a prime-ministerial model rather than a presidential one. 

Turkey is a unitary and centralized state with relatively decentralized local administrations. The multi-party system has evolved gradually since 1946 and faced three military interventions in 1960, 1971 and 1980. The 1982 Constitution is based on the rationalization of parliament and strengthening of the executive. 

Elections and referenda shall be held under the direction and supervision of the judiciary, in accordance with the principles of free, equal, secret and direct voting, universal suffrage, and public counting of the votes. The most recent elections include:
Presidential election on 10 August 2014
Local administration elections on 30 March 2014 
Parliamentary elections on 12 June 2011"
TT,Trinidad & Tobago,27,32,30,"In Trinidad and Tobago, political finance is, for the most part, unregulated. No direct or indirect public funding is provided, and few restrictions on contributions exist. Campaign spending is limited for candidates, but parties are not addressed in the law. In fact, parties are not the subject of any legislation whatsoever, despite their prominent presence in the Trinidadian political scene. Reporting requirements mandate only that candidates submit annual reports. In practice, these reports tend to include some itemized information. Submitted reports are eventually republished in newspapers, but no political finance data is made available online. Third parties play a role in elections, but in law, their independent political activities are not regulated. The Elections and Boundaries Commission of Trinidad and Tobago (EBC) is in charge of monitoring political finance. The EBC does not have audit or investigatory powers. In practice, it also lacks the staff capacity and expertise to substantively monitor political finance, and it neither carries out investigations nor imposes sanctions. Despite several recent efforts to reform how campaigns are financed in Trinidad & Tobago, the regulatory system and its enforcement remain weak.","Trinidad and Tobago is a twin-island Republic (republican status was attained in 1976). It operates under the Westminster/Whitehall model of government. It has a bi-cameral legislature comprised of two houses or chambers, namely the upper house  which is called the Senate and the lower house, which is termed the House of Representatives.  When the two houses meet they are called the Parliament. 

Unlike the Westminster model in the United Kingdom, in nearly all the Anglophone countries of the Caribbean, the modified Westminster model of Government has a written Constitution which is the supreme Law of the Land.  The Head of State is the  President  who is nominated  by the  secret ballots of an electoral college comprising members from both  the Senate ( the upper house) as well as members from the House of Representatives ( the lower house). While some suggest that the office of President is  a 'titular position' the President has numerous powers including the power of 'veto' for Acts of Parliament. In addition he is the Commander of the Armed Forces.  

The Head of Government is the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister is the leader of the party or coalition that controls the majority of  members in the House of Representatives.  The House of Representatives, curently comprised of forty one members of Parliament, is one in which members are elected on the basis of a First-Past-The-Post system of voting. 

Within the forty one constitutencies or districts within the country, any person who attains the majority of the votes cast will serve as a Member of the House of Representatives and also may be selected by the Prime Minister to serve as a Minister/Junior Minister/or Parliamentary Secretary.  Senators, on the other hand are nominated. Sixteen members are selected by the Government, six by the Leader of the Opposition and nine 'independent' candidates are selected by the President of the country.  

While Bills are debated in the House of Representatives, they cannot become laws unless they are debated and agreed to in the Senate. If for some reason, the Senate is unable to agree to the proposal or if they suggest changes, this must be returned to the House of Representatives for amendments. If members of the Senate agree, the Bill is then sent to the President for his ""Assent."" 

In the General Elections of 2010, the United National Congress which formed a coalition with a number of poltical parties, including the Congress of the People, the Movement for Social Justice and the National Joint Action Committee and the Tobago Organization of the People, won twenty nine seats and formed the Government. The Party is referred to as the People's Partnership. The Opposition Party, the People's National Movement, won twelve of the forty one seats.  The current President is Anthony Carmona."
US,United States,67,71,67,"In the United States, direct public funding is available only for presidential candidates, and only if they pledge to abide by spending caps and eschew the collection of other sources of funding. As such, during the 2012 elections, state funds were disbursed only to minor party candidates, as the major party candidates chose to raise and spend more money than they would have received by retaining their eligibility for public funding. No indirect funding or subsidized access to advertising exists. The use of non-financial state resources in campaigns is prohibited, but in at least a few cases, such resources were abused for electoral purposes during recent campaigns. Various restrictions on direct contributions are specified in law, but campaign spending remains unrestricted. This leads to hugely expensive elections in which parties and candidates rely heavily on private donations, many of which come from large individual donors and political action committees. The US system has rigorous reporting requirements. Both candidates and parties must, by law, report regularly on their finances. In practice, the reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) include all direct contributions received. All filed reports are available online in machine readable formats, and are easily accessible to the public. Some third party actors are required to submit detailed financial reports to the FEC. Others, however, including are under no such obligations (see indicator #34 for a complete explanation). This means that, in practice, some information on the independent political activities of third party actors is available to the public, but much of their expenditures, and the donors who finance them, remain dark. The FEC is in charge of regulating political finance. Its members, in practice, are appointed on a partisan basis, and their independence is not guaranteed. The FEC carried out a number of audits after the 2012 elections, and imposed sanctions, some of which were complied with. Most sanctions, however, are relatively light, and are imposed well after the violation occurred, which diminishes their impact. To impose sanctions or initiate an investigation, the FEC needs a quorum of 4 of its 6 members. Three of the commissioners are Republicans and three are left-leaning. As such, they often gridlock, which means that a good deal of potential violations go without investigation. Serious concerns about the FEC's ability to meaningfully regulate political finance exist, and dark money appears to play an increasing role in American politics.","The United states has national elections for a bicameral legislature and a directly elected President. 

The House of Representatives is comprised of 435 voting representatives proportionally representing the population of all 50 states. Each member is directly elected through a first-past-the-post system to a two-year term in their electoral district. Non-voting members represent non-state territories, such as the District of Columbia, Guam, etc. 

The Senate is comprised of 100 Senators, 2 directly elected in each of the 50 States in statewide voting. Senators are elected for six-year terms, with 1/3 of the seats up for election every two years. 

The President is both the Head of State and Head of Government and is elected to a four-year term with an absolute majority of votes, by an electoral college comprising 538 members. Presidential elections coincide with the election of all 435 House seats and 1/3 of Senator seats. Presidents are limited to two terms or, in the case of vice presidents who accede to the presidency, ten years in office.  There are no term limits for representatives or senators.  The most recent presidential election took place on 6 November 2012, and the next election for all House seats and 1/3 of Senate seats taking place 4 November 2014. 

Funding for campaigns is predominantly private, though there is public funding available for presidential campaings if candidates meet certain requirements, including acquiscing to an expenditure cap. However, it is almost entirely private as major presidential candidates have stopped taking public funding. Candidates manage their campaign finances through campaign committees, and other campaign committees (such as party committees and independent political action committees) are also regulated and monitored by the Federal Election Commission. Federal law defines as a “political committee” any organization that raises or spends more than $1000 in a calendar year to influence a federal election. 2 U.S. Code § 431(4). Every candidate for federal office is required to designate a “principal campaign committee,” 2 U.S. Code § 432(e)(1) which must register and file prescribed forms with the Federal Election Commission as well as satisfy certain organizational requirements. Political party committees are also political committees subject to these rules. There are six national party committees – the Democratic National Committee, Republican National Committee, and each party’s campaign committees for the House and for the Senate. State parties that participate in federal elections, including by spending on certain activities that benefit an entire federal-state slate of candidates are subject to federal requirements as are local party committees. Non-party organizations that have the primary purpose of engaging in federal electoral activity, and raise or spend above the threshold amounts, are subject to registration and reporting requirements, too. These include both committees established by corporations and unions (which are barred from giving directly to candidates, but can support candidates through donations raised from people affiliated with those organizations); committees established by non-profit organizations barred from participating directly in electoral politics; and so-called “non-connected committees: that exist for political purposes. In addition, there are groups that are not primarily political – or at least they so contend – that engage in some federal electoral activity but do not have to register as political committees. They will, however, have to report certain kinds of electoral spending that crosses the statutory threshold level.

Most states require parties to nominate candidates in primary elections, so that every election really involves two elections, the primary and the general. Presidential candidates run in primaries or other nominating contests in the states, spread out over many months. Due at least in part to the use of primaries to nominate candidates, as well as the relative weakness of party organizations at the national level, American elections have long been very candidate-centered. Candidates run on party lines, but manage (and finance) their own campaigns, with party support in the general election. 

The Democratic and Republican Parties have long dominated federal elections. Under the Electoral College system, winning the presidential election requires winning pluralities of the popular vote in states, and no independent candidate or party has carried even a single state since 1968. An occasional independent wins election to Congress but they tend to sit with one or the other of the major parties.  At the national level, the two major parties are closely balanced. The Democratic and Republican candidates have each won five of the last ten presidential elections. Democrats have controlled the House for 24 of the last 40 years, although the Republicans have dominated more recently, controlling that chamber for 16 of the last 20 years. Democrats have been the majority in the Senate for 23 ½ of the last 40 years, and 9 ½ of the last 20 years; Republicans had the majority the rest of the time."
UY,Uruguay,46,58,48,"In Uruguay, both parties and candidates receive direct public funding, in law and in practice. No subsidies are granted for access to advertising during campaigns. There are some limits and restrictions on contributions, but campaign spending is not limited to a maximum amount. In practice, public funding tends to be the most important component of campaign financing. No documented cases of violations of contribution limits were found during the 2009 elections. The reporting of financial information is required before and after campaigns, and parties also have to submit detailed accounts of contributions and expenditure on an annual basis. In practice, filed reports are not always completely itemized, nor are they completely inclusive of all donors. At least some of the financial data submitted to the electoral authority is made available online, but formats and standards vary, which makes the information somewhat difficult to analyze and compare. Third party actors are increasingly prevalent in Uruguay, but their independent political activities are not regulated. The Electoral Court is charged with oversight of political finance. Its members, in practice, are not appointed on the basis of their merit, and their independence is not fully guaranteed. The body has neither conducted investigations nor imposed sanctions, and as a result, enforcement in Uruguay is somewhat toothless.","Uruguay has a bicameral legislature with a directly elected presidential executive. Uruguay has a multi-party system, with three dominant political parties.

The House of Representatives shall be composed of ninety-nine members elected directly by the people under a system of proportional representation in which take into account the votes cast for each party throughout the country. The Senate shall consist of thirty members, elected directly by the people, in one constituency. 

The President and Vice President are elected together, directly by an absolute majority of voters. If the absolute majority is not obtained in the first round a second election takes place 30 days later only to determine the president and vice president. Each party may submit a nomination for the Presidency and the Vice Presidency.

The duration of the term in both cases is five years. Consecutive re-election is prohibited but the president may stand for election again after sitting out a term.

In Uruguay Presidential and Parliamentary national elections take place at the same time. The last national election took place on October the 26th, 2014. The prior elections took place in 2009. Voting in Uruguay is legally mandatory."
VE,Venezuela,29,45,16,"Venezuela does not provide direct or indirect public funding for campaigns. Non-financial state resources, however, often featured in the 2013 elections, despite a clear legal prohibition on their use during campaigns. The law restricts very few contributions, and campaign spending is not limited to a maximum amount. Parties thus rely primarily on private funding. Both parties and candidates are legally required to report on their finances during campaigns, and parties must make their accounting books available for examination throughout the year. In practice, it is unclear whether financial reports are comprehensive. The political finance information of parties and candidates is classified in Venezuela, and the public is thoroughly unable to access any data on campaign contributions and expenditure. Unions and other third party actors indirectly participate in campaigns, but their independent electoral activities are not subject to any regulation. The National Electoral Council (CNE) is responsible for overseeing political finance in Venezuela. Its members are appointed by the legislature, but not on merit, and their independence is, in practice, compromised. The CNE is a passive authority, and has neither investigated nor sanctioned any potential violations of political finance laws in recent memory.","Venezuela is a presidentialist system, with a strong executive, a unicameral legislature and a directly elected President.  The President serves as the head of government, and is elected every six years.  The most recent Presidential elections were held in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, who had been elected in 2012.  Nicolas Maduro of the PSUV, a longtime Chavez deputy, won the 2013 election amid much controversy. Maduro's official tally was 50.61%, and Capriles' was 49.12 %; the difference amounted to 223,599 votes in a total of 15.057.480 votes. The candidates were supported by two broad coalitions: Maduro represented the ""Great Patriotic Pole"", an alliance of president Chávez's party, the PSUV, and a variety of minor parties and social organizations, and Capriles headed the ""Board of Democratic Unity"" (MUD, for its Spanish name), a broad alliance of parties ranging ideologically from liberals to marxists  but predominantly social democratic. The campaign and the elections themselves were marred by accusations of abuse of power by the government, inequity in media access by the candidates, and partialization of the electoral authority and the judiciary.

There are, in total, 165 representatives in the legislature. 110 of them are elected by a plurality vote in single member or multiple member districts, while 52 are elected in a closed list proportional representative system, and three are elected in single member indigenous constituencies.The most recent legislative election took place in 2010, and the principal actors were the two coalitions already described. Although the results were very close, (48.2% for the government and 47.2% for the MUD) the electoral system (which over-represents majorities) and the composition of the electoral districts resulted in 58.18% of the seats for the pro-government camp and only 38.78% for the MUD. A third, minority actor, the PPT, whose stand was to avoid the poles and be neutral among them, obtained 3.1% of the vote and 1.21% of the seats.

Mainstream parties finance the campaigns of their candidates, though in very exceptional cases, independent candidates may manage their own campaign funds. In recent presidential campaigns, the alliances have set up central commands concentrating the strategic and tactical operations, as well as the procure of funds. Usually, the presidential candidates themselves are kept at a certain distance from the financial aspects of the campaign."
ZA,South Africa,36,36,47,"In South Africa, public funding is provided, in law and in practice, to political parties for campaigns. Indirect funding, taking the form of free access to advertising, is also available during campaigns. Some non-financial state resources, including public buildings, were inequitably and illegally deployed during the 2014 elections for the benefit of particular parties. There are no restrictions on contribution and expenditure in South Africa. Parties may take in unlimited amounts of money from any kind of donor, and may spend as much as possible during elections. Where reporting requirements are concerned, parties must submit only reports on the use of public funding. No information on private contributions, or the use of those contributions, is mandated by law. This means, in practice, very limited information on the spending of political parties is available to the public. Third party actors are entirely unregulated in South Africa, despite their presence and influence during campaigns. Political finance is overseen by the powerful Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), the members of which are independent and possessing of merit. The IEC is well funded and well staffed, and conducts some investigations, in practice. Sanctions take the form of frozen disbursements of public funding, and are sometimes effective.","South Africa's has a pure closed party list proportional representation (PR) electoral system with no explicit threshold of votes for political parties to be elected (although it as an implicit threshold of approximately 0.25%). Voters don’t vote for individuals, but for a political party, which decides on members to fill the seats it has won. The PR system was chosen after 1994 because it allows for maximum representivity and diversity of political views in legislatures, which was deemed essential for a divided society such as South Africa. National and provincial elections are held every five years. Voters cast two ballots: One for national parliament and one for their respective provincial legislature. South Africa’s most recent elections were its fifth elections held on 7 May 2014 where the governing African National Congress was returned to power with 62% of the national vote and continued as majority party in eight of the country’s nine provinces.

The National Parliament is bicameral. The National Assembly has 400 members and the number of seats that a party has is in proportion to the number of votes cast for it in the national election. The second chamber, the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), is constitutionally mandated to ensure that provincial interests are taken into account in the legislative process and consists of 90 provincial delegates (10 delegates for each of the nine provinces). A provincial delegation consists of six permanent delegates and four special delegates. Seats for the nine provincial legislatures vary according to the size of the population of respective provinces at the time of an election. In the most recent election of 2014 there were a total of 430 seats across all provincial legislatures. Delegates in the National Council of Provinces are nominated in part based on results for parties appearing on parties’ provincial election lists, and in part by the Premiers of those provinces. 

Political parties nominate members for the national and provincial elections on two separate lists, which must be registered with and published by the Electoral Commission (IEC) before an election. Political parties that secure representation in the national and provincial legislatures receive public funding. In the 2014 elections 13 political parties won sufficient votes to secure seats in the National Assembly. There is no separate election for the president, who is elected by the National Assembly after the general election. Section 83 of the Constitution, 1996, provides that the president is head of state and the head of the national executive. Section 86 of the Constitution provides that at its first sitting after its election, and whenever necessary to fill a vacancy, the National Assembly of Parliament must elect a woman or a man from among its members to be the President. The president is elected by a majority of members elected to Parliament. The Chief Justice must preside over the election of the President, or designate another judge to do so.
