Albania,"In Albania, the legal framework established to regulate political finance receives high marks on the Campaign Finance Indicators. Practically speaking, however, enforcement is riddled with deficiencies. Despite the equitable and transparent distribution of direct public funds to political parties and independent candidates, non-financial state resources, like cars, staff, and buildings, the use of which is explicitly prohibited, were frequently abused during the most recent elections. Restrictions on contributions and expenditures are tightly regulated, but the evidence indicates that such restrictions, especially in regards to spending, are often circumvented in practice.  Despite fairly extensive reporting requirements, the information on contributors submitted to the Central Elections Commission (CEC) by parties and candidates is often incomplete. Audit reports of party finances that are available to the public adhere to different formats, and violations and/or abuses of the law happen regularly. Third party actors are marginal figures in Albanian elections, but their influence could increase in the future, as no regulations exist to affect the independent activities of such organizations during campaigns. The CEC, despite having strong legal powers, lacks the practical capacity to investigate and enforce political finance laws. Allegations of abuse, including vote buying, are prevalent, and the CEC in unable to practice effective enforcement in many cases.",,
Argentina,"Argentina has a fairly sophisticated legal framework in place to govern the role of money during elections. In practice, parties receive the direct and indirect public funding to which they are due in law. In spite of clear prohibitions on their use in campaigns, non-financial state resources, including staff, were frequently deployed by the ruling party for electoral purposes during the 2013 campaign. The legal framework includes many restrictions on contribution and expenditure, but the MPT evidence suggests that all national parties violated political finance laws during the 2013 elections. Parties are required to report on their finances somewhat regularly, but in practice, filed reports often fail to include a full list of contributors.  All legal entities, including third party actors, are legally prohibited from engaging in electoral activities. Nevertheless, in practice, some activity occurs, and experts express concerns about the influence of organized crime syndicates during campaigns. The National Electoral Justice is the authority in charge of regulating political finance, and is widely recognized as independent and active. The NEJ carries out investigations and punishes violators, but since the sanctions spelled out in law are weak, parties continue to engage in political finance violations. In spite of its strong regulatory framework, Argentina's practical enforcement mechanisms are dogged by deficits of capacity and capability.",,
Australia,"The Australian political finance system is relatively sparse. Direct public funding is provided to candidates and parties, both in law and in practice, but no laws explicitly prohibit the use of non-financial state resources during campaigns, nor is there subsidized access to advertising. Few restrictions exist to limit contributions or expenditure during campaigns, and only contributions worth more than $12,400 (USD) must be reported. As a result, corporations and individual donors pour a good deal of money into politics, though ascertaining exact funding streams can be a difficult task. Parties and candidates submit financial reports regularly to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), and that information, in practice, is made available to the public in a standardized, machine readable format. In fact, Australia is one of two countries in the MPT sample to meet this standard. Third party actors who spend in excess of $12,400 in campaigns are required to report to the AEC, and that information is eventually made available to the public. Because of the absence of contribution limits, third party actors are not hugely important in Australian campaigns--money can legally be funneled directly to parties and candidates. The AEC is well-respected, and exercises independent investigations. It lacks, however, the legal authority to impose sanctions, and has not initiated prosecutions of violators in more than seven years.",,
Austria,"In Austria, political finance is subject to relatively little regulation. Parties are provided with direct public funding, though the fashion in which allocations and disbursements of state funds are made is not entirely transparent. The abuse of non-financial state resources in campaigns is not explicitly barred, but notably, in practice, no such abuses occurred during the most recent elections. Contributions are largely unrestricted, while both parties and candidates are limited to expenditures of no more than 7 million euros during the course of a campaign. The evidence indicates that at least two parties exceeded those expenditure caps during the 2013 parliamentary elections.  Reporting requirements are sparse: by law, parties must only submit annual financial reports to the electoral authority. In practice, few details are available, and not all reported information is available to the public in standardized, comparable formats. The independent political activities of third party actors are unregulated, and in practice, at least one such actor played a role in the 2013 campaign. Responsibilities for monitoring and enforcing political finance law is split between the Court of Audit and the Transparency Commission, each of which are largely independent, though the Transparency commission is still new, and thus difficult to assess.  The Commission is charged with investigating political finance issues, and does so in practice, but does not make any information on its work available to the public. By the conclusion of the study period, it had yet to impose any sanctions on violators of political finance laws.",,
Bangladesh,"In Bangladesh, no direct or indirect public funding is provided to parties or candidates. Non-financial state resources were frequently abused during the most recent campaign. Some limits on contributions exist, and parties and candidates are both subject to restrictions on spending during campaigns. In spite of existing regulations on these issues, the evidence suggests that limits on both spending and donations are breached regularly. The law specifies some reporting requirements for parties and candidates, but in practice, those requirements are rarely adhered to. The Electoral Commission scans and publishes many of the incomplete reports that they receive, but that information is available only in pdf or hard copy, which makes parsing and analyzing financial reports difficult. Third party actors are present in Bangladesh. However, no laws restrict their independent political activity. The Bangladeshi Electoral Commission is charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance laws, but in practice, the agency is hamstrung by a lack of staff and budget. Despite sometimes imposing sanctions on parties and candidates that violate the legal framework, political actors continue to break the law, and concerns about the Commission's independence and efficacy persist.",,
Belgium,"In law, Belgium provides some direct public funding for parties, though no indirect funding is available. Non-financial resources, by and large, are not abused during election campaigns. Spending during campaigns is limited, as are some forms of contribution, but loopholes exist, including a lack of restrictions on foreign donations and the absence of requirements to mandate the reporting of loans. Violations of the legal regulations pertaining to donations and spending are rare in Belgium. Reporting requirements are relatively sparse: in law, parties must report annually and after elections, while candidates are required to submit only post-election financial reports. In practice, these reports tend to contain only a partially itemized list of donors and the amounts they contribute. Accessing the financial information of political actors is difficult, as reports are only made available to the public for a 15 day period after the conclusion of elections. Further complicating matters is the fact that the information is not accessible in a machine readable format. Despite these issues, few violations of the law occurred during the May 2014 elections in Belgium. The independent activities of third party actors are not regulated by Belgian law, but such organizations have been largely absent to date, with the exception of one organization active during the local elections of 2012. A legislative committee, the Control Commission, is in charge of monitoring and enforcing political finance. As part of the legislature, it cannot be considered independent. Nevertheless, the Commission does have the legal authority to withhold public subsidies from parties it deems in violation of the law, though it rarely does so in practice. Where individual candidates are concerned, the Commission can only refer potential violators to the court system, from whom little information about sanctions is available. The Commission's lack of formal independence, and its weak powers, are seen as impediments to effective enforcement of political finance laws.",,
Bolivia,"Bolivia's political finance regime, due to recent reforms, does not include direct public funding for political parties or candidates. Political advertising is regulated by the electoral authority, which assures free, equitable access to public media advertising slots for all electoral competitors. Non-financial state resources are frequently abused in Bolivia, especially by MAS, the current ruling party. Very few legal restrictions on contribution and expenditure exist: spending during campaigns is not capped, while limits on individual and corporate donations apply only to contributions to parties. In consequence, parties and candidates are largely privately funded, though MAS avails itself of public resources, legally and illegally, on a regular basis. Reporting requirements mandate that parties submit detailed pre and post election reports on their finances, as well as annual reports. Candidates are under no such obligations. In practice, party reports are quite detailed, and include an itemized list of contributions and contributors. None of that information, however, is made available to the public in any format. As a result, the media does not use official political finance data in its reporting. The independent political activities of third party vehicles, such as social organizations and groups of public employees, are not regulated, despite their presence in the electoral landscape. The Bolivian oversight authority, the Electoral Court (TSE), has no explicit investigatory powers in law. Appointments to that body are supposed to be independent and merit-based, but the MPT evidence suggests that they are often, in practice, compromised. The TSE does not investigate potential violations of political finance laws, but it can and does penalize parties for failing to submit their financial reports in the prescribed format. Because the TSE is subordinated to MAS, enforcement is highly uneven.",,
Bosnia and Herzegovina,"Similar to many other Eastern European countries, Bosnia has created a sophisticated political finance regulatory system. In practice, however, de facto realities often do not align with the legal framework. In law, direct public funding exists for both parties and candidates, but allocations are not always made in accordance with the legal formula, and details on disbursements are published only long after money is distributed. Likewise, in law, parties are granted free, equitable access to public media during campaigns, but in practice, the time afforded to different parties frequently fails to accord with the legal requirements Furthermore, non-financial state resources are often abused during campaigns. Contributions and expenditures are highly regulated, though cash donations are not limited in any way. In practice, these limits were regularly contravened during the 2010 elections. Parties are required to report on their finances before and after elections, as well as annually. In practice, reports are often filed late, or not at all, and some contributions are frequently omitted. The Central Elections Commission (CEC) only publishes extracts of filed reports, so limited political finance information is available to the public. Despite reports of third party activity, the independent electioneering of such actors is not regulated by law. The CEC is granted strong legal powers to monitor and enforce political finance, but its ability to rigorously enforce political finance legislation is constrained by a lack of capacity and deficits in operational transparency. Though the CEC imposes sanctions, in practice, parties continue to violate the law, especially where reporting requirements are concerned, on a regular basis. Until more intimidating sanctions are legally defined, and the CEC is given the practical capacity to carry out its remit, enforcement may continue to suffer.",,
Botswana,"In the main, political finance is unregulated in Botswana. No direct or indirect mechanisms of public funding exist, and non-financial state resources are regularly abused during campaigns. Restrictions on contribution and expenditure exist, but are so outdated that the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has not enforced them for many years. According to the law, candidates are supposed to report their financial information after campaigns, but in practice, no such reporting occurs, as the IEC also declines to enforce these provisions. The political actions of third party actors are not at all regulated. The IEC is weak, and plays little role in the enforcement of political finance laws.",,
Brazil,"Brazil, in law and in practice, provides a good deal of direct public funding to parties during campaigns. Indirect funding, in the form of free access to advertising on public and private media, is equitably provided to both parties and candidates. Non-financial state resources, in spite of a ban on their use during campaigns, are often deployed for electoral gain. With the exception of cash donations, most forms of contribution are subject to a limit, but expenditure is essentially uncapped, as parties are supposed to set and adhere to their own unique spending limits. This leads to a situation in which parties stipulate extremely high spending limits that enable huge amounts of campaign expenditures. Limits on contributions are often contravened in practice. In law, parties are subject to extensive reporting requirements, and candidates are supposed to report detailed information during campaigns. In practice, political actors often fail to comply with these requirements, and many reports omit contributions. Submitted reports are made available online, but not all are in standardized, machine readable formats. Violations of political finance laws, including vote buying, were frequent during the 2010 elections. The independent activities of third party actors are not regulated, and many such organizations actively participate in campaigning. The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) is charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance laws, and in practice, the TSE is mostly independent, with appointments made based on merit. It has limited capacity due to the scope of its work, but still carries out investigations into violations, and imposes sanctions on violators. However, only some of these sanctions are complied with, and violations continue to occur. ",,
Bulgaria,"Bulgaria's fairly strong legal framework on political finance is often undermined by in practice violations. Parties are entitled to state subsidies, which they usually receive, but little information on those subsidies is available to the public. Subsidized access to advertising is provided for in the law. However, in contravention of the law, some parties are charged higher rates for campaign spots than others. Non-financial state resources, in practice, featured during the 2013 campaign. Contributions are highly restricted in Bulgaria, as is electoral spending. Nevertheless, in practice, many violations of these limits occurred during the 2013 elections, and parties often find ways by which to circumvent the formal system. Parties are required to report their financial information both within and outside of campaigns, but do not always do in practice, nor do they provide complete lists of their contributors. Further, in practice, financial information is not always available to the public. The independent activities of third party actors are not regulated, and some parties use informally affiliated groups to undertake political activities during campaigns. The National Audit Office (NAO) is the oversight authority charged with monitoring political finance, but it lacks the explicit legal power to investigate potential violations. The independence and efficacy of the NAO is somewhat compromised due to deficits of independence and merit regarding its appointees. That said, it has sufficient capacity to carry out its functions, and does sanction parties who fail to comply with reporting requirements. Nevertheless, repeat violators are frequent. The evidence suggests that, because of the fashion in which many ostensibly independent institutions, including the NAO, are compromised by political influence, equitable enforcement of political finance in Bulgaria is lacking.",,
Chile,"Chile has a strong system of direct and indirect public funding for parties and candidates. In law and practice, public resources are provided equitably and in accordance with legally defined mechanisms. Documented cases of the abuse of non-financial resources during the 2013 elections are rare. Restrictions on contribution and expenditure exist, but loopholes are present within the system. Some forms of anonymous contributions, for example, are permitted. Campaign spending, by both parties and candidates, is limited to a maximum amount. In practice, the evidence indicates that some of the legal restrictions were violated during 2013, and some expenditures may have exceeded the specified limits. Legally established reporting requirements are fairly sparse in Chile - post election reports are required of all political actors, and parties must submit annual reports. In practice, reports usually omit at least some contributors. Incomplete reports and a dearth of standardization mean that, in practice, limited information is available to the public. In law, third party actors are prohibited from engaging in independent political activities. Nevertheless, in practice, some organizations do conduct such activities. The Electoral Service is charged with oversight of political finance, and its leaders are typically independent and appointed, at least in part, based on merit. The Electoral Service has sufficient staff and budget to carry out its responsibilities, but it does not publish information on its investigation results. It can and does impose some sanctions, but equitable enforcement is incomplete, and accusations of dark money continue to pervade Chilean politics.",,
Colombia,"There is a strong legal framework in place in Colombia to regulate political finance issues. Systems of direct and indirect public funding exist, and are equitably enforced in practice. Non-financial resources are occasionally abused during campaigns, but such occurrences are the exception, rather than the norm. Legal restrictions on contributions are substantial, though no law restricts cash donations. Spending during election campaigns is also capped. Interestingly, in spite of the equitable provision of direct public funding, private contributions still account for the bulk of campaign expenditures. Further, violations of limits on contribution and expenditure were reported during the 2014 elections. Reporting requirements in Colombia are stringent, and largely respected in practice. Most political actors adhere to the law, and report the majority of contributions received. In practice, a good deal of political finance information is available to the public, in large part due to the use of Cuentas Claras, an online platform on which financial reports are immediately published upon submission. Violations of the regulatory framework, including vote buying, were present during the 2014 elections. Third party actors are not hugely influential in Colombia, but their independent activities are not regulated by law. The National Electoral Council (NEC) is charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance, but some appointees appear to lack the merit and independence necessary for successfully carrying out their duties. Still, the NEC investigates potential violations, and has sufficient capacity to do so, but is not totally transparent about its investigation results. The body imposes sanctions, most of which are complied with. ",,
Costa Rica,"Costa Rica has a strong legal framework in place to regulate political finance. Direct public funding is provided (in the form of post-election reimbursements), in law and in practice, to political parties, and the abuse of non-financial state resources during campaigns is rare. There is no subsidized or free access to media advertising during campaigns. There is no limit on contributions from individuals, nor are cash donations prohibited or capped. Campaign spending is also unlimited. In practice, this means that parties take out substantial loans to finance campaigns, which they later pay down with the reimbursements provided by the state. Reporting requirements are quite stringent, the law mandating that parties submit detailed financial reports both inside and outside election periods. In general, parties typically complied with these requirements during the 2014 election. The reports are made available to the public, but not in a standardized or machine readable format. Violations of the law were rare during the 2014 campaign. Third party actors are prohibited from engaging in any political activity, but in practice, several ostensibly independent, non-party organizations undertook campaign activities in 2014. The Electoral Court (TSE) oversees political finance. Appointments to the TSE are merit-based, though not public, and its leaders are independent, both in law and in practice. The authority is only slightly constrained by a lack of budget and staff capacity, and carries out investigations when warranted in most cases, though it does not publish all investigation results in a timely fashion. The TSE imposes fines and refers cases for prosecution when necessary, and offenders comply with its sanctions. Despite the strengths of the Costa Rican system, weaknesses remain: in particular, the failure to regulate contributions from individuals, and the lack of a cap on spending during campaigns, have been the subject of reform efforts.",,
Croatia,"Croatia provides public subsidies for parties and candidates during campaigns, both in law and in practice. No indirect funding in the form of subsidized access to media exists, and the evidence indicates that non-financial public resources, including ministry vehicles, were occasionally abused in recent elections. The legal framework restricts many types of contributions and also caps the amount that can be spent during election campaigns. As a result, public funding comprises a huge chunk of party budgets. Few, if any, of the legal limits were violated in the 2014 elections. Parties and candidates are subject to strict legal reporting requirements, the majority of which are complied with in practice. Submitted financial reports are available online, but not in a machine-readable format. Despite these successes, the 2014 elections were marred by numerous violations of political finance laws. Further, no law exists to regulate the independent activities of third party actors during campaigns, even though at least one actor (a football team) engaged in partisan political action during the 2014 campaign. The State Election Committee (SEC) oversees political finance issues. Appointments to the SEC are not merit-based, but the body is at least somewhat independent in practice. It has sufficient capacity to pursue its remit, and regularly investigates potential violations of political finance. However, the SEC lacks the legal authority to impose sanctions, and experts report that this weakens the strength of enforcement in Croatia.",,
Ecuador,"Ecuador provides parties with direct public funding; however, they may not use those funds for campaign purposes. Access to advertising, on the other hand, is available, though it was not distributed transparently and equitably during the 2014 campaign. Non-financial resources were regularly abused during that campaign as well. Restrictions on contributions from individuals and corporations exist in the law, but no ban limits cash contributions. Expenditures during campaigns, however, are capped. Numerous violations of these restrictions occurred during the most recent elections. Where reporting is concerned, parties are required to submit reports both inside and outside campaigns. In practice, submitted reports include complete lists of all contributors, but none of that information is available to the public in a timely fashion. Third party actors are prohibited from any political activity, and the evidence suggests that Ecuador is one of the few countries in the MPT sample in which such organizations have not had any campaign presence. The National Electoral Council (NEC) is responsible for oversight of political finance, but its appointees, in practice, are neither fully merit-based nor independent. A lack of budget and staff complicates its ability to carry out its remit, and the public cannot easily access information on the NEC's investigations. The body does impose sanctions, but offenders do not always comply. According to the MPT research, a lack of transparency on political finance information in general and the NEC's work in particular inhibits the efficacy of Ecuador's regulatory regime.",,
Georgia,"Georgia has a robust political finance system, as illustrated by its adherence to laws that distribute both direct and indirect public funding to parties and candidates. That said, during the 2012 and 2013 elections, non-financial state resources, including staff, were prevalently abused for electoral benefit. In law, there are limits or prohibitions on contributions from foreign sources, individuals, third parties, and corporations, and electoral expenditures are capped. Nevertheless, larger parties are still quite reliant on private donations, and illegal contributions occurred frequently during recent elections. Reporting requirements for both parties and candidates are fairly strict, and reports submitted by both types of actors typically include all of their contributors. All submitted information is published online in pdf (i.e., non machine readable) formats. Third party actors, which feature somewhat prominently in Georgian politics, are subject to reporting requirements, though not all such organizations act within the bounds of the law when conducting their activities. The State Audit Office (SAO) is charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance laws, but its ability to do so equitably is weakened by in practice deficiencies where its appointees' merit and independence are concerned. The SAO does not have the staff to carry out investigations when warranted, and though it imposes sanctions on violators, it is unable to comprehensively police financial flows during campaigns. According to experts, improvements in the competence and independence of the SAO are necessary for enhancing the quality of enforcement.",,
Germany,"Germany's lightly regulated political finance system provides direct public funding for parties and candidates, but full information on exactly when disbursements are made is not available to the public. During elections, parties are granted free access to advertising, both in law and in practice. During the 2013 elections, some parliamentary groups, in contravention of the law, deployed their parliamentary staff in campaign events. Contributions are largely unrestricted, and there is no spending limit during campaigns. Nevertheless, parties appear to rely primarily on state funding and members' fees, while corporate and private donations are less important. Reporting requirements are scant, as only parties are required to submit any financial information -- according to the law, they are supposed to do so annually. Contributions listed on those reports are not itemized, and may not be complete. Received reports are published on the parliamentary website, but are usually in pdf format, and are often quite out of date. Third party actors, including unions and party foundations, are politically active, but are not subject to any regulation. The responsibility for oversight of political finance is split between the President of the Bundestag and the Federal Audit Office. Though the FAO is generally independent, the President of the Bundestag is a political figure. The two bodies generally have the capacity to carry out their duties, but investigations into potential violations are rare, and no information on those investigations is released to the public in a timely fashion. Sanctions are imposed when necessary, but repeat offenders are frequent. Germany's relatively weak legal framework and the opacity of its system, as well as the lack of a strong independent monitoring authority, inhibit the strength and transparency of enforcement.",,
Ghana,"Ghana does not provide parties or candidates with funding, direct or indirect, for electoral campaigning. Few contributions are restricted, and the law does not limit spending during campaigns. Parties and candidates rely primarily on membership dues and self-financing to generate funds. Due to the absence of most regulations, no violations of restrictions were reported during the 2012 elections. Parties are required to report their financial information within and without the campaign season, but in practice, it is not uncommon for them to fail to meet these requirements. Of the information that is submitted, it often fails to include a full list of contributors. Financial reports are not made accessible to the public in a timely fashion. There is no regulation of third party actors in the Ghanaian system. The oversight body, the Electoral Commission, is generally independent, though some of its leaders may have been appointed on a non-merit-basis. In practice, however, the Electoral Commission exercises very little control of political finance. It has not investigated or audited party accounts within the study period due to a lack of capacity, nor has it sanctioned any party for violating the law (despite the fact that several violations have occurred). ",,
Hungary,"In Hungary, direct public funding is provided to parties and candidates, both in law and in practice. However, the agency in charge of making disbursements of state funds does not release detailed information on those payments to the public. Hungarian legislation also mandates that parties be allocated equitable access to advertising on public media, but this is not borne out in practice. Further, non-financial state resources are regularly abused during election campaigns, especially by the ruling part, Fidesz. Electoral spending is capped at a maximum limit, but restrictions on contribution are not as stringent. Cash and anonymous donations are permitted, and there is no limit on donations from individuals. State funds make up the largest chunk of parties' budgets, but other income streams, including private donations, are important. Financial reporting is required only after campaigns and, for parties, annually. In practice, parties and candidates fail to submit full reports on their contributors. Obtaining these reports is difficult for citizens, though journalists and civil society actors have accessed official data in their work. Third party actors are not especially prevalent in the electoral landscape, but those that do exist are not subject to any regulatory requirements. The two authorities in charge of overseeing political finance, the State Audit Office (SAO) and the State Treasury, are staffed by appointees who are not appointed in fully public, merit-based processes. In practice, the independence of the SAO is not fully guaranteed. The SAO does have the capacity to monitor political finance, and carried out some audits after the 2014 elections. However, the SAO does not have the authority to impose sanctions, and those enacted by the State Treasury, which monitors the use of state funding, are too weak to deter violators. ",,
India,"There is no direct public funding for parties or candidates in India. Indirect public funding, however, in the form of free airtime on state run television, is granted to parties. Non-financial state resources were frequently abused during the 2014 elections. No laws restrict cash and anonymous donations, and individuals can legally donate as much as they like. Candidates are legally required to adhere to spending limits during campaigns, but in practice, few actually do. Parties are not subject to any restrictions on expenditure. Candidate limits were regularly breached in the 2014 campaign. In terms of reporting requirements, candidates must report only during campaigns, while parties should submit annual and post election reports. In practice, the reports submitted often lack important details on contributors and donations, and are not totally available to the public. As such, media coverage of official political finance data is scant at best, though violations are common. The independent political activities of third party actors are not regulated, and the public has no access to information on the financial workings of these actors. The Electoral Commission (ECI) is responsible for overseeing political finance. Its appointees are not fully merit-based, and their independence is less than guaranteed. Despite having sufficient staff and budget, the ECI does not audit any party reports, and its recommendations for sanctions are frequently ignored. ",,
Indonesia,"Indonesia's political finance framework makes public funding available for parties, and is distributed according to how many votes were received during the previous election. In practice, obtaining information on how much funding parties received is nearly impossible, as doing so requires filing information requests with parties themselves. Parties and candidates are also granted free access to public media during campaigns; however, in practice, some parties are granted more coverage than others. Further, non-financial state resources are regularly abused during campaigns. Cash contributions are not regulated and though limits cap the amount an individual can donate to presidential candidates and to parties, contributions to members of parliament are not restricted. Corporate donations are limited, and third party actors are not permitted to make direct contributions to campaigns. Spending during campaigns is not capped. Nevertheless, the MPT evidence indicates that actual spending during the campaign season far outstrips the figures reported by parties. Reporting requirements are not comprehensive, and of the reports that are submitted in practice, most fail to include a complete list of contributors. Detailed information on the financial data of political actors is largely unavailable to the public. Third party actors exert influence during campaigns, but as their independent political activities are not regulated by law, little information on their actions is available. The responsibility for enforcing political finance laws is split between two agencies: KPU and Bawaslu. KPU monitors political finance information, and when necessary, refers cases to Bawaslu for investigation. Only KPU can legally impose sanctions, though its powers are limited. Both agencies are independent, with appointees possessing sufficient merit for their positions, but lack the capacity to completely carry out their functions. In practice, Bawaslu does conduct investigations transparently, and KPU does impose sanctions, but violations continue to occur. The KPU's sanctioning authority is limited to administrative fines, and is too weak to deter repeat violators. The limited authority of the oversight bodies hamstrings their ability to meaningfully enforce many political finance regulations.",,
Israel,"Israel provides direct public funding for parties, as well as free access to advertising, though in practice questions arose during the 2013 elections about how airtime was distributed. Multiple cases of non-financial resources being abused also occurred during those elections. By law, individuals are limited in the amount they can contribute to parties, and parties cannot spend more than a certain amount during campaigns. In practice, parties rely on public funding for their financing, while candidates are often reliant on individual donors. During the 2013 elections, a number of parties violated restrictions on contribution. Parties are required, in law, to report on their finances within and without the campaign period, while candidates must do so only during elections. Some reports filed by both parties and candidates fail to include a full list of donors and contributions. Some financial information is available online in pdf or word formats. Media organizations typically rely on the Comptroller's report, which covers the entire electoral process, in their coverage of political finance issues. Only some third party actors are required to report partial information on their independent political activities, and obtaining verified information on their spending and contributions is very difficult in practice. The Comptroller is responsible for overseeing political finance -- he is not chosen in a public process, and in practice, the Comptroller's independence is not guaranteed. The Comptroller did not carry out serious investigations in the wake of the 2013 campaign, and sanctions imposed for administrative violations have not deterred repeat violators. Because of a deficit of formidable sanctioning authority, the Comptroller is unable to ensure compliance with the law.",,
Italy,"In Italy, parties receive direct public funding (though subsidies will be phased out entirely by 2017). They also receive free access to airtime for advertising purposes during campaigns, which, with few exceptions, is distributed equitably and transparently. Non-financial state resources are often used for electoral purposes. Individuals and corporations are limited in how much they can donate to parties, but not to individual candidates, and spending by both parties and candidates is capped during campaigns. Historically, parties are very reliant on public funding, though this will change as allocations of public funds diminish in the next few years. Both parties and candidates are required to report their financial information during campaigns, but only parties must submit reports outside of the campaign season. Submitted reports often contain, at best, a partially itemized list of all contributors, and lack some information. In public, it is difficult for the public to access high quality, machine readable, and standardized political finance information. Vote buying was common in Italy during the 2013 elections, as were other political finance violations. Some third party actors are required to report on their independent political activity, but trade unions and non profits are under no such obligations. This means that, in practice, the political actions of third party actors are mostly opaque. Recent reforms established a monitoring commission but the commission has no investigatory powers, and its appointees are neither completely merit based nor guaranteed full independence in practice. Its capacity to exercise control of political finance is limited, it carries out no investigations, and its administrative sanctions do not prevent frequent violations of the law. ",,
Japan,"Japan has direct public funding for both parties and candidates. This support is distributed in accordance with the legally defined allocation mechanism, but in practice, information on those disbursements is not always available in a timely fashion. Free access to advertising is available for parties contesting seats in the lower house of parliament, and for candidates in the upper house. With the exception of resources available to sitting members of parliament (to which challenging candidates do not have access), non-financial state assets are not deployed during campaigns. Legislation places limits on the amounts individuals, corporations, and foreign sources can contribute for campaign purposes. Party expenditures are not limited, but candidate spending may not exceed a set limit. In practice, certain candidates appear to have attempted to circumvent limits on spending during the most recent elections. In terms of reporting requirements, parties are required to submit financial reports annually, while candidates do so only within campaigns. In practice, the reports submitted do not include many contributions. All submitted reports are published online, but only in pdf format, limiting the extent to which they are easily accessible. Third party actors, despite being present in Japan, are not regulated, either in law or in practice. Several oversight bodies are charged with monitoring and enforcing political finance. In practice, these authorities are afflicted by a lack of merit-based appointees, and concerns about their independence. Investigations are rare, and oversight agencies cannot unilaterally impose sanctions. ",,
Kenya,"In Kenya, parties are entitled to receive direct public funding. In practice, they do so, though some parties have expressed concern that they did not receive the full amounts to which they were entitled in law. Some form of media access is, according to the law, supposed to be provided, but in practice, this has yet to happen. Non-financial state resources are regularly abused during campaigns. Many types of contributions are restricted or limited in law, but electoral spending is subject to no such limitations. Despite legal restrictions, parties and candidates both rely primarily on individual and corporate donors, and some documented abuses occurred during the 2013 elections. Reporting requirements mandate that both parties and candidates submit their financial information during campaigns, but only parties must do so on an annual basis. Submitted reports typically lack detailed information on contributors. Financial data is available to the public, though at a cost. Some third party actors are required to report on their independent activities during campaigns, according to the law, but they frequently fail to do so in practice. Responsibility for monitoring and enforcing political finance laws resides with two bodies: the Registrar of Political Parties and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The evidence suggests that appointments to these agencies are not fully merit-based, and appointees are not totally independent. In practice, very little enforcement occurs, and no sanctions were imposed during the 2013 elections.",,
South Korea,"South Korea, in law and in practice, distributes direct public funding to parties and candidates for campaigns. Indirect public funding, in the form of reimbursements for advertising costs, is also available. Non-financial state resources, however, were used during the 2012 elections. The law restricts a number of modalities of contributions, and also caps electoral spending by both parties and candidates. Parties rely on public funding for roughly 33% of their expenses. Several reports indicate that restrictions on contributions and expenditure were violated during the 2012 elections. Korean law includes extensive reporting requirements inside campaigns, and annual reporting is required outside election periods. In practice, however, many contributions, especially in-kind contributions, are not reported by parties and candidates. Access to political finance information is highly restricted. Most third party actors are prohibited from engaging in political activity, but supporters' associations are allowed to support campaigns, though they are required to report on their activities. In practice, their reports are less than comprehensive, and much of their campaigning remains opaque. The Election Commission is in charge of regulating political finance. In practice, its appointees are not always fully merit-based, nor is their independence completely guaranteed. It has the power to investigate, but chose not to do so after the 2012 elections. When it does impose sanctions, however, offenders always comply. Indeed, in Korea, enforcement of political finance is notably strong.",,
Lebanon,"Lebanon's legal framework regarding political finance is sparse. Neither direct nor indirect public funding are available for parties or candidates. State resources are often abused during campaigns. Some restrictions on contributions to candidate exist, as do candidate expenditures, but parties are wholly unregulated in law. Elections are funded largely by foreign actors, or by candidates themselves. Only candidates are required to report on their finances during campaigns, and no reports are necessary outside the campaign season. In practice, the reports that are submitted tend to lack detailed information on contributors. No financial information is available to the public. Third party actors are not regulated by Lebanese law. The Supervisory Commission on the Electoral Campaign (SCEC) is charged with overseeing political finance, but its leaders are not appointed in merit-based, public competitions, and their independence, in practice, is not guaranteed. The SCEC does carry out some audits, but its sanctions are roundly ignored. The SCEC is too weak to meaningfully enforce political finance law.",,
Malawi,"Malawi has no legislation in place to regulate political finance. The only relevant law is the Constitution, which bans the use of state resources during campaigns. Nevertheless, such resources are often used. No other legislation exists, and enforcement, as a result, is absent.",,
Malaysia,"Malaysia's political finance system does not provide any type of funding, direct or indirect, for parties or candidates. Restrictions on contribution are likewise largely absent, though anonymous donations to candidates are not permitted. During campaigns, candidates may not spend more than a fixed amount, but there is no cap on party spending. In order to generate funds, parties rely on business ventures and membership dues. Reporting requirements are light: according to the law, parties must report on their finances annually, and candidates must do so only once, in a single post-election report. Reports are not completely itemized, and in practice, do not disclose a complete list of donors or donations. Of the information that is submitted, no party reports are made available to the public, and candidate reports, in practice, are accessible only in hard copy for a period of six months after the election. Third party actors appeared in the 2013 elections, but they are not required to report on their financial activities, and no information is available on their independent contributions and expenditure. The Electoral Commission is responsible for overseeing political finance. In law, the Commission is not granted investigatory powers. Its appointees are not appointed based on merit, and their independence, in practice, is not fully guaranteed. The body does not conduct investigations, lacks the capacity to do so, and never imposes sanctions on parties or candidates who violate the law. In Malaysia, not only is the regulatory framework fairly weak, enforcement is less than rigorous.",,
Mexico,"In Mexico, political finance is highly regulated, both in law and in practice. Parties and candidates are both entitled to receive state funding for campaigns; in practice, they do so. Indirect funding, in the form of advertising slots on radio and television, is also provided. In fact, parties and candidates cannot otherwise buy advertising - they must rely exclusively on the slots allocated to them through the indirect public funding mechanism. In practice, some parties found ways to circumvent the law during the 2012 elections, and obtained more advertising time than was their due. There are also a few instances in which non-financial state resources appear to have been illegally deployed in the 2012 campaign. Independent candidates, though not parties, are prohibited from receiving cash donations; anonymous donations and corporate contributions are totally impermissible. Contributions from individuals are capped, and campaign spending is limited for both parties and candidates. Because of these restrictions, parties rely primarily on public funding for their financing, though individual donors and supporters' donations provide supplementary assistance. During the 2012 elections, several candidates and parties spent more than was legally permissible during the campaign. Legal reporting requirements are stringent, and both parties and candidates are supposed to submit itemized financial reports on a regular basis, both within and outside campaigns. These requirements are the result of a new law passed after the 2012 elections, which means that, during those elections, parties and candidates, in practice, reported less frequently. Their reports generally included a full list of donors, a rare case within the MPT sample. Financial reports submitted to the oversight authority, the INE, are available online, but not all information is available immediately, and data is often uploaded in pdf format. Third party actors in Mexico are prohibited from any sort of campaign activity. In practice, however, such actors engaged in campaigning during the 2012 elections, and they did not report any financial information to the authorities. The recently reformed National Electoral Institute (INE) is charged with oversight of political finance. Many of its appointees, in practice, are selected in merit-based processes, and their independence, for the most part, is protected. The INE is active and well staffed; it carries out investigations and audits regularly its predecessor performed more than 1,000 during the 2012 campaign). Its audits are public, and it often imposes sanctions. However, parties and candidates failed to comply with sanctions regarding 2012, instead going through a lengthy appeals process by which to escape censure. Enforcement is likely to improve due to the recently enacted reforms, though carrying out the full scope of its activities may prove a challenge for the INE.",,
Nigeria,"No direct or indirect public funding is available for parties or candidates in Nigeria. Despite a prohibition on the use of non-financial state resources during campaigns, the ruling party availed itself of state buildings, vehicles and staff for campaign purposes in 2011. The legal framework includes some prohibitions on contributions, though a number of loopholes exist. Anonymous donations to parties are not permitted, though candidates may receive them. Individual contributions to parties are capped, but unlimited donations may be made to candidates. Corporations may not give at all to parties, and are limited in how much they can legally contribute to candidates. Foreign financing is banned for parties, but not for candidates. Spending limits are in place, but apply only to candidates, not parties. These patchwork restrictions and the absence of public funding combine to create a system in which parties and candidates rely heavily on private donors, some of whom violate contribution caps. Indeed, violations of both contribution and expenditure were common in the 2011 elections. Legal reporting requirements are not onerous, and apply only to parties. In practice, parties regularly fail to file the required reports: only 2 of 23 parties filed annual reports in 2011. Only summary data in pdf formats is available to the public. Third party actors, in the form of political organizations that support specific campaigns, are present in Nigeria, and they are not subject to any regulations. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is empowered to monitor and investigate political finance issues in Nigeria. Appointments to that body, in practice, are not completely merit-based, and the independence of appointees is not fully guaranteed. In practice, the INEC suffers from capacity constraints, and has largely eschewed any active oversight of political finance. It conducted no investigations in 2011, and imposed no sanctions on violators, despite ample evidence that violations had occurred. Enforcement, therefore, is weak.",,
Pakistan,"In Pakistan, there is no direct or indirect public funding for parties or candidates. Non-financial state resources featured in the 2013 campaign, despite a law banning their use. Contributions to parties are somewhat restricted, but the law ignores candidates in this regard. The reverse holds for campaign expenditures. Candidates are required, in law, to spend less than a specified amount, but party spending is unregulated. The evidence suggests that, though the legal framework is not particularly extensive, even the restrictions on contribution and expenditure were likely violated in the run-up to the 2013 elections. During campaign periods, candidates are required to file financial reports, while parties must submit reports on an annual basis. In practice, not all candidates submit the required reports, and most data is incomplete, without a full list of identifying details for contributors. Political finance information is not available online, though it can be obtained in hard copy at photocopying cost, or in pdf. Third party actors are not subject to reporting requirements, though unions and some religious groups do appear to exercise some influence in campaigns. Enforcement in Pakistan is less than robust. The leaders of the Electoral Commission are not appointed in public, completely merit-based processes, and their independence is not guaranteed. The Commission's budget and staff are not sufficient for comprehensive oversight. It performed no audits or investigations after the 2013 elections, and many of its administrative sanctions were ignored by violators.",,
Panama,"In law and in practice, Panama provides public funding for parties during election campaigns. Free airtime on public media is also provided. Though the law bans the use of non-financial state resources during campaigns, during the 2014 campaign, the government took advantage of numerous such resources. There are few restrictions on contribution and expenditure. Individual donations are not limited, and electoral spending is likewise uncapped. In terms of reporting, parties are required to submit quarterly financial reports outside of elections, and both parties and candidates must submit post-election reports. In practice, many candidates failed to submit the financial reports required by law after the 2014 elections. Those that did, however, typically included a fully itemized list of their contributors. Very little political finance information is available to the public. Third party actors exert some influence in Panamanian elections, but are not regulated in law. The Electoral Tribunal is responsible for the oversight of political finance issues. In practice, not all three members of the Tribunal were appointed based on merit, but their independence is largely guaranteed. It has most of the staff and budget it needs to carry out its functions. Nevertheless, in practice, the Tribunal did not perform any investigations in 2014, and it rarely sanctions parties and candidates that fail to submit the reports required by law. Deficits in transparency and enforcement inhibit the strength of Panama's political finance regime.",,
Paraguay,"In Paraguay, direct public funding is provided for parties. The distribution and allocation of that funding, however, is not entirely transparent. Non-financial state resources were regularly abused during the 2013 campaign, but indirect public funding in the form of free advertising slots was equitably distributed to parties and eligible candidates. Limits cap the amount that individual donors, corporations, foreign sources, and third parties can give to parties, while there are no restrictions on contributions to candidates. Campaign spending is capped only for parties, though in practice, parties employed a variety of strategies to circumvent those caps during the 2013 elections. In terms of reporting requirements, parties are required to submit detailed reports during and outside of campaign periods. In practice, reports often lack the requisite detail, and very little political finance information is made available to the public. Third party actors engaging in partisan campaign activities, especially nonprofits, are present in Paraguay, but their independent expenditures and contributions are not regulated. The Electoral Justice (TSJE) oversees political finance. In practice, appointments to the TSJE are not definitively merit-based, and appointees are not independent of other branches of government. The TSJE did not perform any audits or investigations after the 2013 campaign, nor did it sanction potential violators. Because the TSJE is politically compromised, enforcement is fairly weak.",,
Peru ,"In law, the Peruvian system provides direct public funding for parties. However, in practice, funding has never actually been disbursed. Indirect public funding, in the form of free access to advertising during campaigns, is also provided for in law, though the in practice use of advertising slots did not fully align with legal prescriptions in the 2011 campaign. Non-financial state resources, especially staff, were frequently used for illegal campaign purposes in the run-up to the most recent elections. Anonymous donations are permitted in Peru, but all direct personal, corporate, and third party donations are capped. Electoral spending, however, is not limited in any fashion. The MPT evidence suggests that parties and candidates collected illegal contributions during the last campaign period. Reporting requirements mandate the filing of financial reports during and outside campaigns. In practice, however, parties often fail to comply with those requirements, and exclude some contributors from their reports. Some political finance data is made available online in pdf. The independent political activities of third party actors are not regulated, which allows a variety of organizations to influence campaigns in opaque ways. The National Electoral Authority (ONPE) monitors political finance, but it lacks the legal authority to carry out in depth audits or investigations. That said, its leaders are appointed on merit, and in practice, are independent of other branches of government. Nevertheless, the ONPE cannot and does not investigate or impose sanctions on violators. Current legislation does not provide the ONPE with the tools to more successfully regulate political finance in Peru.",,
Philippines,"In the Philippines, no direct public funding is provided by the state for campaigns, though parties and candidates, in law, receive subsidized access to advertising. In practice, however, advertising slots are not always distributed equitably. Non-financial state resources, as in many countries, are regularly abused during elections. There are few restrictions on contributions during campaigns, but electoral spending is capped for both parties and candidates. During the 2013 elections, parties and candidates made regular attempts to circumvent those spending limits. Those contesting elections are only required to report on their financial information once, at the conclusion of the 90 day campaign period. In practice, the submitted reports are quite detailed, and contain extensive lists of contributors. Reports filed with the authorities are available to the public in non-machine-readable formats. Third party actors are active in the Philippines, but their independent political activities are not regulated. The Commission on Elections, COMELEC, is responsible for monitoring and enforcing political finance laws. The appointment of commissioners is often politicized, but some guarantees, in practice, protect the independence of commissioners once they assume office. As such, COMELEC carries out frequent investigations, and sanctions violators of the law regularly. Sanctions, however, are not always successfully implemented, as candidates in particular avoid paying the prescribed fees. Recent reforms have greatly expanded COMELEC's remit, and enforcement, as such, is currently strong, especially relative to the situation in the recent past.",,
Poland,"Poland has an extensive regulatory framework for political finance in which, in law and in practice, parties can receive direct public funding. Free access to advertising on public media is also provided for parties and candidates. The use of other, non-financial state resources is banned, but during the 2010 presidential elections, some such resources were deployed for electoral benefit. Contributions are highly regulated, and electoral spending is also capped. Parties and candidates are required to submit financial reports during campaigns, while only parties must do on an annual basis. In practice, those reports typically include most contributors, though some omissions occur. The information that is submitted during elections is available as scanned copies online, but accessing other reports, including annual reports, and more detailed data, is difficult. Third party actors are increasingly relevant during campaigns, but they are not required to report any information on their independent political activities. The National Electoral Commission (NEC) oversees political finance. Its members are not appointed in public processes, but are otherwise qualified, and in practice, their independence is protected. The NEC has sufficient budget and staff, but carries out relatively few in depth audits during campaigns. When it imposes sanctions, usually for failures to submit the necessary financial reports, offenders comply. Gaps exist in the political finance legal framework, especially where reporting requirements are concerned, but generally, enforcement in Poland is strong.",,
Romania,"In Romania, parties, in law and in practice, receive direct public funding. Indirect funding, in the form of free access to advertising on public media, is granted to both parties and candidates. Other, non-financial state resources, however, are frequently abused for campaign purposes in Romania. Contributions to both candidates and parties are highly regulated, and electoral spending is capped for both actors as well. Despite the extensive legal framework in this regard, parties elude the legally specified limits on contribution and expenditure in various ways. Reporting requirements in Romania mandate that all parties and candidates file financial reports during campaigns; only parties must report outside of campaigns. Despite legal requirements, in practice, the names of contributors are regularly excluded from reports. All submitted financial information, however, is made available online in pdf formats. Third party actors, especially NGOs that are closely tied to particular parties, are involved in election campaigns, but their independent political activities are not subject to any regulation. The Electoral Permanent Authority (AEP) oversees political finance. Its appointees are highly politicized, but there are some in practice guarantees in place to protect their independence. The AEP is active in its oversight role, as it carries out investigations and imposes sanctions, despite having some budgeting and staffing constraints. Offenders usually comply with the sanctions imposed, but repeat offenders occasionally appear. ",,
Russian Federation,"Russia has a strong political finance regime, and is a good example of a country in which political finance regulations, rather than encouraging a level playing field, actually restrict electoral competition. Direct public funding is awarded to parties in the form of post election reimbursements, in law and in practice, on the basis of electoral performance. Free access to advertising is provided to parties and candidates, but during the 2011 and 2012 elections, slots were distributed so as to privilege the ruling party's campaign. Further, non-financial state resources were frequently deployed by the ruling party for electoral purposes. Contributions are highly restricted, and a cap is in place for electoral spending by both parties and candidates. In practice, however, many violations of these restrictions occurred during recent elections. In law, parties and candidates both are required to report their financial information during campaign periods, but outside the campaign, only parties must file reports. In practice, submitted reports often fail to include all contributions, especially in-kind contributions, and are not fully itemized. Some of the submitted information is published online, and of that, some is in a machine readable format. Third party actors, despite being active in Russian campaigns, are not regulated. The Central Elections Commission (CEC) is in charge of enforcing political finance law. The CEC is highly politicized, and typically focuses its regulatory power on opposition parties. It is largely opaque in its operations. The CEC cannot impose sanctions on parties or candidates found to have violated the law, so it passes along recommendations to other government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance and the General Prosecutor, when pursuing punishments. Violators typically comply with the imposed sanctions. That said, due to the CEC's bias, rules are selectively enforced so as to favor the ruling party, and restrictions on contributions inhibit opposition parties ability to meaningfully contest elections.",,
Rwanda,"In Rwanda, there is direct public funding, both in law and in practice, for parties and candidates. Funds are disbursed after campaigns. No indirect funding is provided. Non-financial state resources are often abused. With the exception of a ban on contributions from foreign sources to political parties, contributions and expenditure are not restricted in the least. In the absence of contribution limits, parties are funded by their members and the business ventures they control. Reporting requirements in Rwanda are very light: the only requirement articulated in law is that parties must submit financial reports on an annual basis. Only contributions over more than one million Rwandan francs have be included in the reports. Further, no reporting during campaigns is necessary, and candidates do not have to report at all. This means that, in practice, very little meaningful political finance data is reported, and even less is easily available to the public, which can only access submitted reports by request. Interestingly, there were no documented cases of political finance violations during the 2010 and 2013 elections. This is explained by the fact that, in a largely unregulated political finance regime, breaking the law is nigh on impossible. Third party actors are not regulated in Rwanda. The Office of the Ombudsman is responsible for oversight of political finance issues. Appointees, in practice, are not chosen in public, merit-based processes, and the independence of Ombudsmen is not guaranteed. Nevertheless, the office carried out at least 16 investigations into political finance during the 2010 and 2013 elections, though it released no information on the results of those audits. It has limited power to impose sanctions, but its edicts are complied with when they are issued. In general, Rwanda's political finance regulatory framework is very weak. Few laws address the issue, and despite the power of the Ombudsman, little practical enforcement occurs.",,
Serbia ,"Political finance is highly regulated in Serbia. Direct public funding is available for parties, and in practice, it is allocated equitably and in a transparent fashion. Indirect funding, in the form of access to advertising in public media, is also awarded, but opposition parties are typically consigned to unfavorable timeslots in contravention of the law. The use of other state resources, including staff, vehicles, and buildings, is prohibited. In practice, however, such resources are regularly abused during campaigns. Contributions are highly regulated, but no limits check the amount of spending that can legally occur. In practice, despite the limits on donations that are in place, the evidence indicates that violations occur. Where reporting is concerned, parties are required to submit regular financial reports both during campaigns and on an annual basis. In practice, filed reports are quite detailed, though in-kind contributions are sometimes not represented properly. Filed information is available online, but not in machine readable formats. Third party actors are not regulated. The Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) is responsible for oversight of political finance. The ACA is independent, and its appointees are selected in merit-based, public competitions. Its staff and budget, however, are too small for it to conduct complete oversight. The ACA carried out some investigations of political finance issues after the last elections, but complete information on those investigations is unavailable. When it imposes sanctions, parties usually comply, but repeat offenders exist. ",,
Slovenia,"In Slovenia, both parties and candidates are entitled to receive reimbursements after the conclusion of campaigns. In practice, they do so. Indirect public funding in the form of free access to public media is also provided, though in the 2011 and 2014 parliamentary elections, some parties received more advertising slots than they should have according to the allocation mechanism prescribed in law. Non-financial state resources are often abused in Slovenian campaigns. Contributions are highly regulated, and there is also a cap on spending during campaigns. The spending cap is applicable to both candidates and parties. Few, if any, violations of these limits have occurred during recent campaigns, making Slovenia a relatively rare case among the countries researched for this project. During campaigns, both parties and candidates are required to submit financial reports; outside of the campaign season, only parties have to file annual reports on their financial dealings. Filed reports are somewhat detailed, though many lack a full list of contributors. Some third party actors, notably party academies, conduct campaign activities, but they are not subject to any regulation. The Court of Auditors, a highly respected institution, oversees political finance. In practice, its members are appointed in public, merit-based processes, though their independence is not fully guaranteed. The Court of Auditors has a relatively large staff and budget, and it conducted numerous audits during the 2011 and 2012 elections. The results of its investigations are transparent. Regarding sanctions, the Court of Auditors has not imposed many in recent years, but some penalties have been complied with. ",,
Solomon Islands,"The Solomon Islands do not have systems of direct or indirect public funding. Non-financial state resources often featured in the 2010 campaign. The legal framework does not include many restrictions on contributions. Candidate spending is limited, but parties are able to spend as much as they like during campaigns. Both parties and candidates, in law, must file financial reports after the campaign season, and parties must also submit annual reports. In practice, few parties or candidates actually file the required information. The data that is submitted is concerned solely with expenditures. No contribution data is available. Further, the public cannot, in practice, any political finance information. The independent political activities of third party actors are totally unregulated. The Political Parties Commission (PPC), newly established in 2014, has the power to oversee the finances of political parties, but not independent candidates who are not party members. The PPC's members are not appointed on merit, nor are they fully guaranteed independence. During the most recent elections, the Electoral Commission was still in charge of regulating political finance -- its ability to conduct oversight was highly limited, and it did not successfully impose any sanctions after the last campaign. ",,
South Africa,"In South Africa, public funding is provided, in law and in practice, to political parties for campaigns. Indirect funding, taking the form of free access to advertising, is also available during campaigns. Some non-financial state resources, including public buildings, were inequitably and illegally deployed during the 2014 elections for the benefit of particular parties. There are no restrictions on contribution and expenditure in South Africa. Parties may take in unlimited amounts of money from any kind of donor, and may spend as much as possible during elections. Where reporting requirements are concerned, parties must submit only reports on the use of public funding. No information on private contributions, or the use of those contributions, is mandated by law. This means, in practice, very limited information on the spending of political parties is available to the public. Third party actors are entirely unregulated in South Africa, despite their presence and influence during campaigns. Political finance is overseen by the powerful Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), the members of which are independent and possessing of merit. The IEC is well funded and well staffed, and conducts some investigations, in practice. Sanctions take the form of frozen disbursements of public funding, and are sometimes effective. ",,
Sri Lanka,"In Sri Lanka, parties are entitled to direct public funding. In practice, disbursements are made, but not in a transparent fashion. Access to advertising in public media is provided, both in law and in practice, for both parties and presidential candidates. Other, non-financial state resources were regularly abused during the 2010 elections. No restrictions on contribution or expenditure are codified in law, meaning that parties and candidates can receive and spend unlimited amounts during campaigns. Reporting requirements are also sparse. The only legal requirement is that parties submit annual reports to the Commissioner of Elections. In practice, filed reports are not detailed, and very little political finance information is available to the public. Third party actors are not regulated by Sri Lankan law. The Commissioner of Elections is charged with overseeing political finance. In practice, however, the Commissioner has to date failed to fulfill this role. As such, enforcement is weak.",,
Sweden,"The Swedish political finance system provides direct public funding for both parties and candidates. This funding takes the form of reimbursements after campaigns, and is applied equitably in practice. Parties and candidates do not, however, receive any indirect assistance. Intriguingly, Sweden does not explicitly ban the use of non-financial state resources during campaigns, and yet, no such resources are used. This fact makes Sweden one of a few outliers in the MPT sample. Restrictions on contribution and expenditure are mostly nonexistent. For funding, parties rely primarily on public disbursements, though private donations and party held businesses also provide some financing. A new 2014 law now requires parties and candidates have to report on their contributions received on an annual basis. No other requirements exist, and the law has not yet been in place long enough to assess whether, in practice, reports are actually filed. Before the passage of this new law, parties came to an informal agreement by which they self-published their contributions received each year. This meant that, in practice, the public had access to some political finance information, but no data on expenditures was available. The independent political activities of third party actors are not regulated under Swedish law. The 2014 reform designated a new authority, the Legal, Financial, and Administrative Services Agency (LFAS), to oversee political finance. In law, the LFAS does not have investigative powers, though it can enforce sanctions for failures to comply with the law. At the time of this research, the LFAS had yet to oversee an election campaign, making it difficult to assess its enforcement of sanctioning authority.",,
Thailand ,"The political finance situation in Thailand is currently complicated by the ongoing political crisis, in which the Constitution and other legislation were suspended indefinitely. According to the Constitution, parties are entitled to direct public funding. In practice, that funding was distributed in early 2014, but then returned to the authorities after the Constitution's suspension. Parties also, in law, receive free air time for advertising. However, the turmoil in Thailand affected the distribution of advertising slots, resulting in a less than equitable situation. The legal framework sets forth several restrictions on contributions, and also limits the amount that can be spent during elections. Some financial information must be reported: parties and candidates must submit post election financial reports, and parties must file additional reports annually. In practice, the submitted reports contain some information on contributors. Some of that data is then published online in pdf formats, but not all of it is accessible to the public. The independent political activities of third parties actors are not regulated in Thailand. The Election Commission of Thailand (ECT) is charged with oversight of political finance. In practice, appointees to the ECT are not chosen on merit, nor is their independence protected. Nevertheless, the body does have a substantial staff and budget, and conducted several investigations into potential violations in the wake of the 2014 elections. Sanctions imposed by the ECT are typically respected.",,
Trinidad & Tobago,"In Trinidad and Tobago, political finance is, for the most part, unregulated. No direct or indirect public funding is provided, and few restrictions on contributions exist. Campaign spending is limited for candidates, but parties are not addressed in the law. In fact, parties are not the subject of any legislation whatsoever, despite their prominent presence in the Trinidadian political scene. Reporting requirements mandate only that candidates submit annual reports. In practice, these reports tend to include some itemized information. Submitted reports are eventually republished in newspapers, but no political finance data is made available online. Third parties play a role in elections, but in law, their independent political activities are not regulated. The Elections and Boundaries Commission of Trinidad and Tobago (EBC) is in charge of monitoring political finance. The EBC does not have audit or investigatory powers. In practice, it also lacks the staff capacity and expertise to substantively monitor political finance, and it neither carries out investigations nor imposes sanctions. Despite several recent efforts to reform how campaigns are financed in Trinidad & Tobago, the regulatory system and its enforcement remain weak.",,
Turkey,"There is direct public funding for parties in Turkey, both in law and in practice. Turkish law also provides indirect assistance, in the form of access to media during campaigns. Non-financial state resources are widely abused during campaigns. Restrictions on contribution apply only to parties and to presidential candidates; no limits constrain the size of donations to parliamentary candidates. Despite these loopholes, violations of the law are, in practice, relatively frequent. Campaign spending is not limited for any actor. In terms of reporting requirements, parties are supposed to submit annual financial reports, and presidential candidates are required to file reports after the conclusion of campaigns. Parliamentary candidates are not obligated to report any financial information. In practice, many of the reports that are filed do not include in-kind contributions or their contributors. Direct political finance data is not accessible to the public. Third party actors and their campaign activities are under no regulation in Turkey. Responsibility for monitoring political finance is split between two bodies: the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Board of Elections. The former is responsible for parties' compliance with the law, while the latter oversees presidential candidates. Concerns about the merit of the members of these bodies exist, and their independence is not fully guaranteed. In practice, neither authority conducts investigations. Nevertheless, sanctions imposed on violators are often, but not always, complied with. Enforcement in Turkey is weakened by the bifurcation of responsibilities between two separate authorities, and by loopholes that reduce the effectiveness of the current legal framework. ",,
United Kingdom,"The United Kingdom has a strong framework in place to regulate political finance, and enforcement is equally strong. Direct public funding is provided to parties, and it appears to be distributed equitably. However, those funds cannot be used during campaigns. Indirect public funding, in the form of free access to broadcast media, is also provided to parties. In practice, that airtime is given out fairly and transparently. Parties are not permitted to independently purchase airtime or otherwise advertise on television during campaigns. Relevant legislation restricts few forms of contribution, but spending during campaigns is capped for both parties and independent candidates. Based on data from the 2010 elections, parties did not even approach the spending limits codified in law. Parties, by law, must report on their finances regularly, both inside and outside campaigns. Independent candidates must do so only after the campaign period, while regulated donees (defined as members of registered parties, including members of parliament and candidates) have to regularly report on contributions received every month. In practice, most parties, candidates, and donees comply with these requirements, and most submit detailed lists of their contributors, though some exceptions exist. The UK Electoral Commission regularly publishes submitted political finance information online in a searchable database. Third party actors are active in UK elections, and those that spend in excess of a certain amount on independent campaign activities are required to report on their political activities. This means that some, though not all, third party organizations are subject to regulations, and that some, though not all, data on their expenditures is publicly available. The Electoral Commission oversees political finance. Its commissioners are typically appointed on merit, and their independence is, by and large, guaranteed. The Commission carried out multiple investigations in the wake of the 2010 elections, and imposed administrative sanctions, most of which were complied with. In general, the enforcement of political finance in the UK has greatly improved since reforms instituted in 2009.",,
United States,"In the United States, direct public funding is available only for presidential candidates, and only if they pledge to abide by spending caps and eschew the collection of other sources of funding. As such, during the 2012 elections, state funds were disbursed only to minor party candidates, as the major party candidates chose to raise and spend more money than they would have received by retaining their eligibility for public funding. No indirect funding or subsidized access to advertising exists. The use of non-financial state resources in campaigns is prohibited, but in at least a few cases, such resources were abused for electoral purposes during recent campaigns. Various restrictions on direct contributions are specified in law, but campaign spending remains unrestricted. This leads to hugely expensive elections in which parties and candidates rely heavily on private donations, many of which come from large individual donors and political action committees. The US system has rigorous reporting requirements. Both candidates and parties must, by law, report regularly on their finances. In practice, the reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) include all direct contributions received. All filed reports are available online in machine readable formats, and are easily accessible to the public. Some third party actors are required to submit detailed financial reports to the FEC. Others, however, including are under no such obligations (see indicator #34 for a complete explanation). This means that, in practice, some information on the independent political activities of third party actors is available to the public, but much of their expenditures, and the donors who finance them, remain dark. The FEC is in charge of regulating political finance. Its members, in practice, are appointed on a partisan basis, and their independence is not guaranteed. The FEC carried out a number of audits after the 2012 elections, and imposed sanctions, some of which were complied with. Most sanctions, however, are relatively light, and are imposed well after the violation occurred, which diminishes their impact. To impose sanctions or initiate an investigation, the FEC needs a quorum of 4 of its 6 members. Three of the commissioners are Republicans and three are left-leaning. As such, they often gridlock, which means that a good deal of potential violations go without investigation. Serious concerns about the FEC's ability to meaningfully regulate political finance exist, and dark money appears to play an increasing role in American politics.",,
Uruguay,"In Uruguay, both parties and candidates receive direct public funding, in law and in practice. No subsidies are granted for access to advertising during campaigns. There are some limits and restrictions on contributions, but campaign spending is not limited to a maximum amount. In practice, public funding tends to be the most important component of campaign financing. No documented cases of violations of contribution limits were found during the 2009 elections. The reporting of financial information is required before and after campaigns, and parties also have to submit detailed accounts of contributions and expenditure on an annual basis. In practice, filed reports are not always completely itemized, nor are they completely inclusive of all donors. At least some of the financial data submitted to the electoral authority is made available online, but formats and standards vary, which makes the information somewhat difficult to analyze and compare. Third party actors are increasingly prevalent in Uruguay, but their independent political activities are not regulated. The Electoral Court is charged with oversight of political finance. Its members, in practice, are not appointed on the basis of their merit, and their independence is not fully guaranteed. The body has neither conducted investigations nor imposed sanctions, and as a result, enforcement in Uruguay is somewhat toothless.",,
Venezuela,"Venezuela does not provide direct or indirect public funding for campaigns. Non-financial state resources, however, often featured in the 2013 elections, despite a clear legal prohibition on their use during campaigns. The law restricts very few contributions, and campaign spending is not limited to a maximum amount. Parties thus rely primarily on private funding. Both parties and candidates are legally required to report on their finances during campaigns, and parties must make their accounting books available for examination throughout the year. In practice, it is unclear whether financial reports are comprehensive. The political finance information of parties and candidates is classified in Venezuela, and the public is thoroughly unable to access any data on campaign contributions and expenditure. Unions and other third party actors indirectly participate in campaigns, but their independent electoral activities are not subject to any regulation. The National Electoral Council (CNE) is responsible for overseeing political finance in Venezuela. Its members are appointed by the legislature, but not on merit, and their independence is, in practice, compromised. The CNE is a passive authority, and has neither investigated nor sanctioned any potential violations of political finance laws in recent memory. ",,
